title = {Relative target estimation using a cascade of extended Kalman filters},
year = {2017},
    abstract = { This paper presents a method of estimating inertial target positions from a moving vehicle, without any assumptions on the shape of the terrain or the target motion. The tracking vehicle runs two cascaded estimators. The first is an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF), which is responsible for tracking the vehicleâ€™s state. The second estimator is an EKF that is responsible for estimating a fixed number of landmarks within the cameraâ€™s field of view. Landmarks are parameterized by a quaternion associated with bearing from the cameraâ€™s optical axis and an inverse distance parameter. The bearing quaternion allows for a minimal representation of each landmarkâ€™s direction and distance, a filter with no singularities, and a faster update rate due to few trigonometric functions. Three methods for estimating the inertial target positions are demonstrated: the first uses the landmark estimator directly on a moving target, the second computes the target depth with a weighted average of converged landmark depths, and the third extends the targetâ€™s measured unit vector to intersect a ground plane constructed from the converged landmark estimates. }

    abstract = { In this paper we propose a simple non-linear observer for attitude estimation based only on output from a typical inertial measurement unit (IMU) and dynamic pressure sensor embarked on a low-cost unmanned aerial vehicle. In particular, we aim to provide a good quality attitude estimate in the absence of global positioning system (GPS) ground truth and with potential low-frequency bias and high-frequency noise in the IMU sensor measurements. In addition, the case where the IMU only provides gyrometer and accelerometer outputs is considered; that is, there is no magnetometer output or it cannot be used due to local magnetic disturbances such as are common on a vehicle with electric motors. The proposed observer uses a simple centripetal force model (based on gyrometer and dynamic pressure measurements), augmented by a first-order dynamic model for angle of attack, to estimate non-inertial components of the acceleration. This estimate is used to correct the accelerometer output to provide a low-frequency estimate of the gravitational direction. This inertial direction, along with the gyrometer output, is then used to drive a fully non-linear attitude observer posed on the orthogonal group of rotation matrices SO(3). The observer is augmented with an integral state that ensures compensation of gyrometer bias. The resulting observer is simple to implement and fully non-linear. Experimental results are provided on a real-world data set and the performance of the filter is evaluated against the output from a full GPS/inertial navigation system (INS) that was available for the data set. }

time-based path optimizer presented in this paper provides a path planning method that
takes advantage of long-range ADS-B information and addresses the associated challenges.
It is capable of robust, long-range path planning and is computationally ecient enough
to run successively for increased robustness. The ultimate result of this research is a time-
based path planner that is suitable for a sense-and-avoid solution on small UAS in the
National Airspace System.},

Pose estimate take features, estimates 3D using stereo and the finds rotation R and translation t by minimizing the reprojection error.  RANSAC is used to eliminate outliers caused, for example, by motion in the frame.

	Abstract = {Several key developments for autonomous mobile robots},
	Annote = {This paper gives a high level description of model predictive motion planning as defined by the authors.  The planning method consists of local motion planning and global motion planning.  Their idea with local motion planning is to parameterize the path by a small number of parameters.  Rather than sampling the input space (like RRT), they sample the constraint space, meaning, they sample final positions and orientations.  Trajectories are then planned to each final position/orientation, and evaluated against a metric.  The authors claim that this method is much faster than input sampling.  Global graph search uses a library of possible maneuvers to on a varying resolution lattice.  The lattice is searched, as opposed to search points with a Euclidian metric, which is faster but less accurate.

	Abstract = {Abstract---We propose a semi-direct monocular visual odometry
algorithm that is precise, robust, and faster than current
state-of-the-art methods. The semi-direct approach eliminates
the need of costly feature extraction and robust matching
techniques for motion estimation. Our algorithm operates
directly on pixel intensities, which results in subpixel precision
at high frame-rates. A probabilistic mapping method that
explicitly models outlier measurements is used to estimate 3D
points, which results in fewer outliers and more reliable points.
Precise and high frame-rate motion estimation brings increased
robustness in scenes of little, repetitive, and high-frequency
texture. The algorithm is applied to micro-aerial-vehicle stateestimation
in GPS-denied environments and runs at 55 frames
per second on the onboard embedded computer and at more
than 300 frames per second on a consumer laptop. We call our
approach SVO (Semi-direct Visual Odometry) and release our
implementation as open-source software.},

	Abstract = {Abstract---In this paper, we present a monocular visualinertial
odometry algorithm which, by directly using pixel
intensity errors of image patches, achieves accurate tracking
performance while exhibiting a very high level of robustness.
After detection, the tracking of the multilevel patch features is
closely coupled to the underlying extended Kalman filter (EKF)
by directly using the intensity errors as innovation term during
the update step. We follow a purely robocentric approach
where the location of 3D landmarks are always estimated
with respect to the current camera pose. Furthermore, we
decompose landmark positions into a bearing vector and
a distance parametrization whereby we employ a minimal
representation of differences on a corresponding -Algebra
in order to achieve better consistency and to improve the
computational performance. Due to the robocentric, inversedistance
landmark parametrization, the framework does not
require any initialization procedure, leading to a truly powerup-
and-go state estimation system. The presented approach is
successfully evaluated in a set of highly dynamic hand-held
experiments as well as directly employed in the control loop of
a multirotor unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV).},

	Abstract = {This paper discusses three algorithms for the problem of asynchronous Track-to-Track Fusion (AT2TF) with track delays, where the information configuration of T2TF with partial information feedback (AT2TFpf) is used. This is the most practical configuration for AT2TF with time delays, since communication delays make full information feedback very complicated. The first algorithm is the optimal memoryless AT2TF under the Linear Gaussian (LG) assumption (denoted as AT2TFpfwoMopt), which is also the linear minimum mean square error (LMMSE) fuser without the Gaussian assumption. The second is the Information Matrix Fusion for asynchronous T2TF (denoted as AT2TFpfIMF), which is an extension of the synchronous IMF algorithm. Both algorithms are novel. The third is an approximate AT2TF algorithm proposed by Novoselsky (denoted as AT2TFpfAppr). Among the three algorithms, only the first one theoretically guarantees the consistency of the fuser. The latter two algorithms involve certain degrees of heuristics. Simulation results show that, for the scenarios considered, AT2TFpfIMF is also consistent and has similar level of tracking accuracy as AT2TFpfwoMopt. On the other hand, AT2TFpfAppr has consistency problems. Further more, due to the simplicity of AT2TFpfIMF compared to AT2TFpfwoMopt, it is an appealing candidate for practical applications.},

@article{Tian2008,
	Abstract = {Track-to-track association (T2TA) is very important in distributed tracking systems. When the fusion center receives multiple tracks from a local tracker, T2TA needs to be performed before track-to-track fusion (T2TF). The problem of T2TA, similar to measurement-to-track association, can be formulated and solved as an assignment problem, whose costs are based on the likelihood of assigning a local track to a central track, namely, the likelihood of the hypothesis H<sub>0</sub>: the two tracks originated from the same target. Thus the basic hypothesis test of whether two tracks are for the same target is very important for T2TA. Compared to the measurement-to-track association, T2TA has two features: i) The local track is correlated with the central track that has the same origin with it, due to the common process noise of the target. ii) Multiple frames of data are available from both the tracks. Thus, two issues are of concern for the T2TA test, namely, the derivation of the exact test statistic needs to take into account the crosscorrelation between the tracks; and how should multiple frames of data from the tracks be utilized. In this paper, the exact algorithm for calculating the test statistic for T2TA using multiple frames of data is derived. To keep the complexity of the algorithm under control, a limit is set for the number of the frames of data used in the test, which leads to a sliding window test for the problem of T2TA. By accounting for the cross-correlations between tracks for the same target and the cross-correlations across time of the terms entering into the test statistics, the proposed test for T2TA yields false rejections of H<sub>0</sub> that match the theoretical values. Then the sliding window test is compared with the single time test. It is shown that the intuitive belief ldquothe longer the window, the more the power of the testrdquo is not necessarily correct. Thus, caution should be used when using multiple frames of data from the tracks -

	Abstract = {Abstract: Structure from motion (SfM) computer vision is a remote sensing method that is gaining popularity due to
its simplicity and ability to accurately characterize site geometry in three dimensions (3D). While many researchers
have demonstrated the potential for SfM to be used with unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to model in three dimensions
various geologic features such as landslides, little is understood how the selection of the UAV platform can affect
the resolution and accuracy of the model. This study evaluates the resolution and accuracy of 3D point cloud models
of a large landslide that occurred in 2013 near Page, Arizona that were developed from various small UAV platform
and camera configurations. Terrestrial laser scans (TLS) were performed at the landslide and were used to establish a
comparative baseline model. Results from the study indicate that point cloud resolution improved by more than 16%
when using multi-rotor UAVs instead of fixed-wing UAVs. However, accuracy of the points in the point cloud model
appear to be independent of the UAV platform, but depend principally on the selected camera and the image resolution.
Additional practical guidance on flying various UAV platforms in challenging field conditions is provided for geologists
and engineers.},

	Abstract = {Abstract---Due to their high fault-tolerance and scalability to large networks, consensus-based distributed algorithms have recently gained immense popularity in the sensor networks community. Large-scale camera networks are a special case. In a consensus-based state estimation framework, multiple neigh- boring nodes iteratively communicate with each other, exchanging their own local information about each target's state with the goal of converging to a single state estimate over the entire network. However, the state estimation problem becomes challenging when some nodes have limited observability of the state. In addition, the consensus estimate is suboptimal when the cross-covariances between the individual state estimates across different nodes are not incorporated in the distributed estimation framework. The cross-covariance is usually neglected because the computational and bandwidth requirements for its computation become unscal- able for a large network. These limitations can be overcome by noting that, as the state estimates at different nodes converge, the information at each node becomes correlated. This fact can be utilized to compute the optimal estimate by proper weighting of the prior state and measurement information. Motivated by this idea, we propose information-weighted consensus algorithms for distributed maximum a posteriori parameter estimation, and their extension to the information-weighted consensus filter (ICF) for state estimation. We compare the performance of the ICF with existing consensus algorithms analytically, as well as experimen- tally by considering the scenario of a distributed camera network under various operating conditions.},

	Abstract = {The measurement selection for updating the state estimate of a target's track, known as data association, is essential for good performance in the presence of spurious measurements or clutter. A classification of tracking and data association approaches has been presented, as a pure MMSE approach, which amounts to a soft decision, and single best-hypothesis approach, which amounts to a hard decision. It has been shown that the optimal state estimator in the presence of data association uncertainty consists of the computation of the conditional pdf of the state x(k) given all information available at time k, namely, the prior information about the initial state, the intervening known inputs, and the sets of measurements through time k. It has also been pointed out that if the exact conditional pdf, which is a mixture, is available, then its recursion requires only the probabilities of the most recent association events. The conditions under which this result holds, namely whiteness of the noise, detection, and clutter processes, were presented. The PDAF and JPDAF algorithms, which carry out data association and state estimation in clutter, have been described. A simple example was given to illustrate how the clutter and occasional missed detections can lead to track loss for a standard tracking filter, and how PDAF can keep the target in track under such circumstances. By using the Monte Carlo in a simulated based surveillance as an exampled shown. The numerous applications of the PDAF/JPDAF illustrated in "Real-World Applications of PDAF and JPDAF" show the potential pitfalls of using sophisticated algorithms for tracking in difficult environments as well as how to overcome them. The effect of finite sensor resolution can be a more severe problem than the data association and deserves special attention.},

	Abstract = {Abstract---Obstacles detection is used nowdays for a number
of road safety applications, increasing the drivers awareness in
potential dangerous situations. A reliable and robust obstacles
detection continues to be largely investigated and still remains
an open challenge, especially for difficult scenarios and in
general cases, with loosened constraints and multiple simultaneous
use-cases. This work presents an obstacles detection,
tracking and fusion algorithm which allows to reconstruct the
environment surrounding the vehicle. While the techniques used
for the detection are well-known in literature, the improvements
introduced by this paper regard the data association and
tracking approach of heterogeneous sensors observations. An
innovative multi-dimensional structure based on association
costs originating from a classifier provides an optimal solution
to the association problem with respect to the total association
cost. An Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) managing a variable
number of observations, arbitrarily composable, allows to correctly
address the combined tracking and fusion challenge. The
results, obtained on a public benchmark, show improvements
with respect to state of the art systems.},

tracking a group of ground static targets in an
urban area using xed wing unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs).
In this scenario, UAVs are equipped with sensors that are
subject to the constraints of urban area occlusions. Information
regarding the line of sight (LOS) occlusions in the urban
area is assumed available. Each UAV, considering the dynamic
constrains arising from the xed wing, is modeled as a Dubins
car. The motion planning of searching the shortest path for
UAVs, namely Dubins path, is a NP hard problem. We propose
an algorithm, which can provide sub-optimal Dubins path,
hence can bring a closed-loop path for UAVs to continuously
track the group of static targets and minimize the time of loss
track. The proposed algorithm is validated through simulations
on a visual database that is based on the CBD in Singapore.},

	Abstract = {Abstract---Distributed algorithms have recently gained immense popularity. With regards to computer vision applications, distributed
multi-target tracking in a camera network is a fundamental problem. The goal is for all cameras to have accurate state estimates for all
targets. Distributed estimation algorithms work by exchanging information between sensors that are communication neighbors.
Vision-based distributed multi-target state estimation has at least two characteristics that distinguishes it from other applications. First,
cameras are directional sensors and often neighboring sensors may not be sensing the same targets, i.e., they are naive with respect to
that target. Second, in the presence of clutter and multiple targets, each camera must solve a data association problem. This paper
presents an information-weighted, consensus-based, distributed multi-target tracking algorithm referred to as the Multi-target
Information Consensus (MTIC) algorithm that is designed to address both the naivety and the data association problems. It converges
to the centralized minimum mean square error estimate. The proposed MTIC algorithm and its extensions to non-linear camera models,
termed as the Extended MTIC (EMTIC), are robust to false measurements and limited resources like power, bandwidth and the realtime
operational requirements. Simulation and experimental analysis are provided to support the theoretical results.},

	Abstract = {AbstractÂ—Over the past few decades, the computational
power has been increasing rapidly. With advances of the
parallel computation architectures it provides new opportunities
for solving the optimal estimation problem in realtime.
In addition, sensor miniaturization technology enables us
to acquire multiple measurements at low cost. Kolmogorov's
forward equation is the governing equation of the nonlinear
estimation problem. The nonlinear projection lter presented
in the late 90's is an almost exact solution of the nonlinear
estimation problem, which solves the governing equation using
Galerkin's method. The lter requires high-dimensional
integration in several steps and the complexity of the lter
increases exponentially with the dimension of systems. The
current parallel computation speed with the usage of many
sensors at the same time make it feasible to implement the
lter efciently for practical systems with some mild dimension
sizes. On-line or off-line multi-dimensional integration is to
be performed over the parallel computation using the Monte-
Carlo integration method and random samples for the state
update are obtained more efciently based on the multiple
sensor measurements. A few simplications of the lter are
also derived to reduce the computational cost. The methods
are veried with two numerical examples and one experimental
example.},

The radar return from stationary ground-based scatterers is used to create a range-compressed image, which can be used to estimate the relative motion of the UAV. The Hough transform is used to extract scatterer features from the range-compressed image and to solve the data association problem. The estimated relative motion of the aircraft based on radar return is then fused with inertial measurement unit data in an extended Kalman filter. Radar data collected during actual flight tests are compared to truth data as estimated using a global positioning system sensor to demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm. Robustness properties of the algorithm are explored using simulation studies.},

	Abstract = {Introduces a generalized framework, termed "stochastic cloning," for processing relative state measurements within a Kalman filter estimator. The main motivation and application for this methodology is the problem of fusing displacement measurements with position estimates for mobile robot localization. Previous approaches have ignored the developed interdependencies (cross-correlation terms) between state estimates of the same quantities at different time instants. By directly expressing relative state measurements in terms of previous and current state estimates, the effect of these crosscorrelation terms on the estimation process is analyzed and considered during updates. Simulation and experimental results validate this approach.},
	Annote = {This paper shows how to process relative sensor measurements at a slow rate relative to a key frame when high rate IMU is also available.

The basic idea is to add an additional state to the Kalman filter that represents the state at the instant that a key frame is established.  The Kalman filter then proceeds as normal, but the relative measurements are with respect to the key frame, which is a state in the Kalman filter.

Related to our work on relative navigation.

short-comings associated with the MEMS sensors and embedded processors that are fre-

estimation: 1) kinematic propagation, 2) attitude representation, and 3) the assumptions
on the behavior of the angular rate vector between samples. Forward Euler integration
and matrix exponential propagation methods are compared within several attitude rep-
resentations, namely the direction cosine matrix (DCM), quaternions, Euler angles, and
the angle-axis scheme. Assumptions of constant, linear, and quadratic angular velocities
between samples are also examined. The resulting algorithms are evaluated according to
accuracy, computational load, and noise response. Unit tests using analytic inputs and
integration tests using each approach within the complementarylter framework of the
SLUGS autopilot are performed to evaluate algorithm performance against
ight test data
from an integrated GPS/INS system. The results of the experiments indicate that the
matrix exponential with quaternion attitude representation delivers higher accuracy with
low penalty on the computational burden and no signicant dierence for noise resilience.},

based on homography, angular velocity, and specific acceleration
measurements is proposed. This corresponds to the
typical situation of a mono-camera/IMU sensor facing a (locally)
planar environment. By lifting the estimation state space to
a higher-dimensionnal space, we show that the problem can
be formulated as a linear estimation problem. This allows
for the application of classical estimation techniques, e.g.,
Kalman filtering. Based on this linear formulation, we also
determine explicitly the motion conditions that ensure uniform
observability of the system, and we propose a simple linear
Luenberger-like observer. A validation of the proposed solution
based on real data is presented.},

below. Importantly, a Lie group and its Lie algebra are intimately related, allowing calculations in one
to be mapped usefully into the other.

This document does not give a rigorous introduction to Lie groups, nor does it discuss all of the

	Abstract = {This paper presents a vision-based three-tiered path planning and collision avoidance scheme for small and miniature air vehicles (MAVs), which consists of global, local, and reactive path planners. The global path planner generates inertial paths to the goal configuration based on a known world map that may not necessarily be up-to-date. The local path planner builds maps in the local-level frame of the MAV based on vision data and plans paths to manoeuvre around obstacles with time-to-collision horizon around 3--10 s. The reactive path planner reacts to visually sensed obstacles with time-to-collision horizon less than 3 s by pushing the images of the obstacles to the edges of the image plane, thus avoiding obstacles. A strategy that effectively combines the three path planners is designed to globally guide the MAV to the goal configuration while locally avoiding obstacles. Simulation results show the scheme is successful in solving path planning and obstacle avoidance problems for fixed-wing MAVs in urban terrain.},

	Abstract = {This paper presents a strategy for optimal estimation of
parameters for towed cable systems using moving horizon estimation
(MHE). The main contributions of the work include a novel
formulation of MHE using a dead-band that explicitly rejects
measurement noise, real-time implementation results, and the
investigation of time-varying stochastic disturbances as well as
unknown yet constant disturbances. Further analysis is conducted
on the observability and sensitivity of key parameters to determine
which parameters can be estimated by the proposed approach using
real-time streaming data from experiments. In addition to the
real-time results, an offline multiobjective optimization is conducted
to reveal the tradeoff between the computational burden and
estimation variation. A Pareto frontier is used to demonstrate a
series of optimal experimental configurations obtained by adjusting
the model complexity (number of cable links and horizon steps).
Finally, a multivariate parameter estimation is performed to explore
the applicability of the proposed approach in simultaneously
estimating multiple parameters.},

	Abstract = {Relative pose estimation between fixed-wing unmanned
aerial vehicles (UAVs) is treated using a stable and
robust estimation scheme. The motivating application of this
scheme is that of ``handoff'' of an object being tracked from one
fixed-wing UAV to another in a team of UAVs, using onboard
sensors in a GPS-denied environment. This estimation scheme
uses optical measurements from cameras onboard a vehicle,
to estimate both the relative pose and relative velocities of
another vehicle or target object. It is obtained by applying the
Lagrange-d'Alembert principle to a Lagrangian constructed
from measurement residuals using only the optical measurements.
This nonlinear pose estimation scheme is discretized
for computer implementation using the discrete Lagranged'Alembert
principle, with a discrete-time linear filter for
obtaining relative velocity estimates from optical measurements.
Computer simulations depict the stability and robustness of this
estimator to noisy measurements and uncertainties in initial
relative pose and velocities.},

unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) is a challenging problem
due to cluttered urban environments and coordination of nonholonomic
UAV motion. Our previous work has demonstrated
in simulation that machine learning can be used in such an
environment to learn a model of target motion and thereby
improve tracking performance. We extend this previous work
by creating a more realistic simulation using road network and
building height data extracted from downtown San Diego. We
demonstrate effectiveness of target motion model learning in
the new simulation environment. Additionally, we demonstrate
performance improvement by extending the algorithm used to
coordinate the UAVs for tracking the urban target.},

	Abstract = {Abstract---The random sample consensus (RANSAC) algorithm
was developed as a regression algorithm that robustly estimates
the parameters of a single signal in clutter by forming many simple
hypotheses and computing how many measurements support that
hypothesis. In essence, RANSAC estimates the data association
problem of a single target in clutter by identifying the hypothesis
with the most supporting measurements. The newly developed recursive-RANSAC
(R-RANSAC) algorithm extends the traditional
RANSAC algorithm to track multiple targets recursively by storing
a set of hypotheses between time steps. In this technical note we
show that R-RANSAC converges to the minimum mean-squared
solution for well-spaced targets. We also show that the worst-case
computational complexity of R-RANSAC is quadratic in the number
of new measurements and stored models.},

	Abstract = {This paper presents a vision-aided uniformly semi-globally exponentially stable (USGES)
nonlinear observer for estimation of attitude, gyro bias, position, velocity and specic force
of axed-wing Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV). The nonlinear observer uses measure-
ments from an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU), a Global Navigation Satellite System
(GNSS) receiver, and a video camera. This paper presents a nonlinear observer representa-
tion with a computer vision (CV) system without any assumptions related to the distance
to objects in the images and the structure of the terrain being recorded. The CV utilizes
a camera and the continuous epipolar constraint to calculate body-xed linear velocity.
The observer is named a Continuous Epipolar Optical Flow (CEOF) nonlinear observer.
Experimental data from a UAV test
ight and simulated data are presented showing that
the CEOF nonlinear observer has robust performance. Experimental results are compared
with an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) and illustrate that the estimates of the states con-
verge to the correct values. Results show that using the proposed CV in addition to IMU
and GNSS improves the accuracy of the estimates. The CV provides accurate informa-
tion about the direction of travel of the UAV, which improves the attitude and gyro bias
estimate.},
	Address = {San Diego, CA},
	Annote = {This paper addresses the problem of developing a complete nonlinear observer that uses GPS, IMU, but also optical flow.  A Lyapunov proof for the convergence of the observer is provided, but it is somewhat incomplete because it references other papers.

The optical flow computation is interesting because it uses both SURF features, and also template matching.

The key idea is to use the epipolar constraint in the derivation of the nonlinear observer. Unfortunately the derivation of the observer equations is not very insightful.  Also, I wonder about the fact that the observer for the rotation matrix is not constrained to SO(3).

Good experimental and simulation results.},

	Abstract = {Abstract---In this paper, we explore the concept of a trackersensor
feedback loop, i.e., how tracker output can inform
sensor processing, and investigate whether it can improve
multiple target tracking performance and enable stationary
object detection in video. Our implementation of the trackersensor
feedback loop is based on the Gaussian Mixture Models
(GMM) foreground detector. We modify the standard GMM
algorithm by measuring target extent directly from the foreground
mask and by zeroing out the background update rate of
pixels associated with valid tracks. Our tracker-sensor feedback
loop is incorporated into the Recursive-RANSAC framework.
Recursive-RANSAC, a novel multiple target tracker, is enhanced
with the inclusion of the probabilistic data association filter and
nearly constant jerk motion model. We apply our algorithm to
several pseudo-aerial videos that are similar to what might be
captured from a UAV platform. The multiple object tracking
precision and accuracy (MOTP and MOTA) and optimal
sub-pattern assignment (OSPA) metrics are used to measure
tracking performance. Tracker-sensor feedback is shown to
produce a significant improvement in the number of missed
detections, false positives, and track label switches. In terms of
stationary object detection, we demonstrate our method's ability
to indefinitely detect parking cars and abandoned luggage (from
the PETS 2006 dataset) despite frequent occlusions and other
detection challenges.},

``Critical issues determining a successful intercept will be the
time remaining until intercept, the amount of acceleration available,
and the errors which must be taken out.''

distance.

Explains radome effects and how they cause porposing in missiles.

Explains why greater acceleration is better for endoatmospheric intercepters,

The algorithm takes into account vision occlusions due to

the probability of the target's current and predicted locations,

the path planning algorithm is designed to generate paths

a nominalmathematicalmodel, which provides an approximate inversion

which may arise from imperfect modeling, approximate inversion, or

algorithm ensures that all of the signals in the loop are uniformly
bounded and that the weights of the on-line neural network tend to

A series of extremum seeking control(ESC) algorithms are executed to search the best pose to observethe target. Since there is no existing method to detect when ESChas converged, we propose a novel frequency domain criteria todecide when to terminate the current ESC and launch another onthe next candidate sphere.We prove that, under certain conditions,ESC will converge to known neighborhood of the optimal point infinite time. Simulations and experiments are presented to illustratethe effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.},
	Annote = {The objective of that paper is to search for optimal viewing poses for a camera attached to the end of a robot manipulator. Since the problem is NP complete, the paper uses three sequential dynamic optimization processes to find a solution. Not only does the paper effectively employ two state-of-the-art optimization algorithms (extremum seeking and multidirectional direct search), but it also makes a nice contribution to the extremum seeking literature by deriving a clever stopping criteria based on the frequency of the dither signal. The stopping criteria is necessary to perform multiple extremum seeking optimization steps, to further optimize the estimated range to the target. This paper is a very nice example of a paper that combines solid theoretical results with impressive and non-trivial experimental validation.},

	Abstract = {This paper introduces a new approach for three-dimensional flight path optimization for unmanned aerial vehicles. It considers the performance of the air vehicle as well as mission specific requirements including the avoidance of no-fly areas, risk reduction in threat environments by terrain following flight or terrain masking low-level flight, and other regulations such as fixed release and approach vectors at the start and destination locations. The focus of the approach is on a proper discretization of the airspace by a network which allows the application of standard algorithms of combinatorial optimization. In contrast to conventional discretizations by grids or grid-like graphs, our network is non-regular since created by some random process. Moreover, each path in the network corresponds to a twice continuously differentiable trajectory which obeys the kinematic restrictions of the air vehicle and which is feasible with respect to the operational requirements of the mission. With suitable costs defined on the edges of the network, a minimum-cost path calculation allows to identify a trajectory of shortest length, shortest flight time, minimum flight height, or minimum visibility from the ground. The latter objectives aim to minimize the probability of being detected by hostile forces, hence increasing the survivability of the air vehicle.},

The novelty of the algorithm is that it takes into accountvision occlusions due to obstacles in the environment. The algorithmuses a dynamic occupancy grid to model the target state,which is updated by sensor measurements using a Bayesian filter.Based on the current and predicted target behavior, the path planningalgorithm for a single vehicle (UAV/UGV) is first designed tomaximize the sum of the probability of detection over a finite lookaheadhorizon.

To date, the most common method of handling delayed data in sensing networks has been to use a conservative time alignment of the observation data with the filter time. However, by accounting for the correlation between the late data and the filter over the delayed period, an exact solution is possible. The inclusion of this information correlation term adds little extra complexity, and may be applied in an information filter update stage which is associative. The delayed data algorithm can also be used to handle data that is asequent or out of order. The asequent data problem is presented in a simple recursive information filter form. The information filter equations presented in this paper are applied in a decentralised picture compilation problem. This involves multiple aircraft tracking multiple ground targets and the construction of a single common tactical picture.},

A derivation of a nonlinear observer on SE(3) is presented, using a Lyapunov function conveniently expressed as a function of the difference between the estimated and the measured landmark coordinates. The resulting feedback laws are explicit functions of the landmark measurements and velocity readings, exploiting the sensor information directly in the observer. The proposed observer yields almost global asymptotic stabilization of the position and attitude errors and exponential convergence in any closed ball inside the region of attraction. Also, it is shown that the asymptotic convergence of the estimation error trajectories is shaped by the landmark geometry and observer design parameters. The problem of non-ideal velocity readings is also considered, and the observer is augmented to compensate for bias in the angular and linear velocity measurements. The resulting position, attitude, and bias estimation errors are shown to converge exponentially fast to the desired equilibrium points, for bounded initial estimation errors. Simulation results are presented to illustrate the stability and convergence properties of the observer. {\copyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

detect targets at distances ranging from 400m to about 900m.

These distances (with some assumptions about closing speeds

between 8-10 seconds ahead of impact, which approaches the

12.5 second response time recommended for human pilots. We

make use of the enormous potential of graphic processing units

Two fourth-order autoregressive with exogenous input (ARX) models are identified to present the attitude characteristics of the longitudinal (pitch) and the lateral (roll) control channels, respectively. The validity of the identified model is verified by both time-domain model prediction and frequency-domain spectral analysis. Based on the proposed ARX models, two compensators are further designed using a frequency-domain method, and then added to the closed-loop control systems to improve the transient performance of the pitch- and roll-control channels.

	Abstract = {Location: Ref DB 9 Keywords: Nonlinear Tracking Robust Inversion Multivariable
Comments: A nonlinear feedback multivariable controller is used to
implement tracking in a nonlinear system. The tracking error is measured
by a general function of system state and the input command. The
controller is robust in the sens that the tracking error is ultimately
bounded in the presence of modeling errors. Free parameters, which
affect the form of the controller, allow flexibility in determining
such factors as: The size of the ultimate bound, the rate of error
decay, excursion of the control, conditions on the class of modeling
errors, and the level of system gain. Restrictive asumptions on the
structure of the model and the modeling errors are required but they

We take a supervised learning approach to this problem, in which
we begin by collecting a training set of monocular images (of unstructured

learning to predict the depthmap as a function of the image. Depth
estimation is a challenging problem, since local features alone are
insufficient to estimate depth at a point, and one needs to consider
the global context of the image. Our model uses a discriminatively-trained
Markov Random Field (MRF) that incorporates multiscale local- and
global-image features, and models both depths at individual points
as well as the relation between depths at different points. We show
that, even on unstructured scenes, our algorithm is frequently able

In a recent paper, Erdinc, Willett, and Bar-Shalom argued for the need for a PHD-type filter which remains first-order in the states of individual targets, but which is higher-order in target number. In this paper we show that this is indeed possible.

Pontryagin's maximum principle Comments: An approximation method
is presented to construct an optimal state regulator for a nonlinear
system with quadratic performance index. The nonlinearity is taken
to be a perturbation to the system, and a parameter $\epsilon$ is
introduced to stand for it. By making use of a power-series expansion
in $\epsilon$, a sequence of partial differential equations is derived
whose solutions form a subopimal feedback law. Given a polynomial
nonlinearity, the partial differential equations are reduced to ordinary
differential equations by separation of variables. The zero-order
terms yield a well known Riccati equation. Higher-order equations
are transformed into conventional type linear equations, owing to
a lemma regarding an extended Liapunov equation. It is demonstrated
that the l-th order approximation for the feedback law results
in the (2l+1)th order approximation to the optimal performance.

The procedure developed has a wide variety of applications. As one
of the straightforward applications, the synthesis of a suboptimal
control is discussed for a large-scale system as composed of several
subsystems of lower dimensions.

Three examples attached illustrate several features of the method.

a nonlinear estimation scheme that allows the development

of accurate and robust system estimates in the presence of nonlinearities,

noise, and faults, in real time. Traditional state estimation

for linear systems has a rich, elegant theory, namely, the stochastic

Kalman filter. Extension of Kalman filtering theory, especially

guarantees, to nonlinear systems is nontrivial. The extended Kalman

filter (EKF) (see Ref. 1) is an approximate extension of Kalman

filtering techniques to nonlinear systems by linearizing the state

dynamics at each time step. The EKF does not require linearity,

stability, or time invariance of the system; it does require that
the

state dynamics are sufficiently differentiable, that is, the Jacobian

exists. Although the EKF is quite flexible and well used in applications

such as radar tracking and global positioning systems,

disadvantages include sensitivities to required a priori information

(initial state and noise environment), which can lead to bias and
even

	Abstract = {Abstract--- The paper proposes a complete real-time control

algorithm for autonomous collision-free operations of the

quadrotor UAV. As opposed to fixed wing vehicles the

quadrotor is a small agile vehicle which might be more

suitable for the variety of specific applications including

search and rescue, surveillance and remote inspection. The

developed control system incorporates both trajectory

planning and path following. Using a differential flatness

property the trajectory planning is posed as a constrained

optimization problem in the output space (as opposed to the

control space), which simplifies the problem. The trajectory

and speed profile are parameterized to reduce the problem to

a finite dimensional problem. To optimize the speed profile

independently of the trajectory a virtual argument is used as

opposed to time. A path following portion of the proposed

algorithm uses a standard linear multi-variable control

technique. The paper presents the results of simulations to

demonstrate the suitability of the proposed control algorithm.},

	Abstract = {This paper considers the problem of obtaining good attitude estimates from measurements obtained from typical low cost inertial measurement units. The outputs of such systems are characterized by high noise levels and time varying additive biases. We formulate the filtering problem as deterministic observer kinematics posed directly on the special orthogonal group SO (3) driven by reconstructed attitude and angular velocity measurements. Lyapunov analysis results for the proposed observers are derived that ensure almost global stability of the observer error. The approach taken leads to an observer that we term the direct complementary filter. By exploiting the geometry of the special orthogonal group a related observer, termed the passive complementary filter, is derived that decouples the gyro measurements from the reconstructed attitude in the observer inputs. Both the direct and passive filters can be extended to estimate gyro bias online. The passive filter is further developed to provide a formulation in terms of the measurement error that avoids any algebraic reconstruction of the attitude. This leads to an observer on SO(3), termed the explicit complementary filter, that requires only accelerometer and gyro outputs; is suitable for implementation on embedded hardware; and provides good attitude estimates as well as estimating the gyro biases online. The performance of the observers are demonstrated with a set of experiments performed on a robotic test-bed and a radio controlled unmanned aerial vehicle.},

	Abstract = {Abstract---In active sonar and radar applications measurements
consist of range, bearing and often range rate.When tracking
using range and bearing measurements only, the performance
of a Converted Measurement Kalman Filter (CMFK) exceeds
that of a mixed coordinate Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) if an
unbiased conversion from polar to Cartesian coordinates is used.
Performance is further enhanced if estimation bias is eliminated
by evaluating the converted measurement error covariance using
the state prediction. The extension of the CMKF to use range
rate as a linear measurement is possible, but limited to cases
with small bearing errors. The use of range rate as a nonlinear
measurement requires the use of an EKF. Due to the poor
performance of the EKF in some situations, various modifications
have been proposed, including use of a pseudo measurement, an
alternative linearization of the measurement prediction function,
and sequentially processing the converted position and range rate
measurements (applied to the EKF and the Unscented Kalman
Filter). Common to these approaches is that the measurement
prediction function remains nonlinear. The goal of this work is
to develop a measurement conversion from range, bearing and
range rate to Cartesian position and velocity that is unbiased
and consistent. The approach is then applied to a CMKF with
appropriate elimination of conversion bias and estimation bias.
Performance is compared to the conventional EKF and the EKF
with alternative linearization (AEKF).},

	Abstract = {Airborne collision detection is a difficult problem due to inherent noise, errors in prediction, and challenges associated with modeling the dynamics of the intruder aircraft. Moreover, onboard limited computational resources, fast closing speeds, and unanticipated maneuvers make it challenging to detect collision without creating too many false alarms. In this paper, an innovative approach is presented to quantify likely intruder trajectories and estimate the probability of collision risk for a pair of aircraft flying at the same altitude and in close proximity given the state estimates provided by an airborne radar sensor. The proposed approach is formulated in a probabilistic framework using the reachable set concept and the statistical data contained in the uncorrelated encounter model developed by Lincoln Laboratory, Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Monte-Carlo-based simulation is used to evaluate and compare the performance of the proposed approach with linearly extrapolated collision-detection logic.

	Abstract = {Performance and stability are demonstrated for a nonlinear path-following
guidance method for unmanned air

vehicles. The method was adapted from a pure pursuit-based path following,
which has been widely used in ground

based robot applications. The method is known to approximate a proportional-derivative
controller when following

a straight line path, but it is shown that there is also an element
of anticipatory control that enables tight tracking

when following curved paths. Ground speed is incorporated into the
computation of commanded lateral

acceleration, which adds an adaptive capability to accommodate vehicle
speed changes due to external disturbances

such as wind. Asymptotic Lyapunov stability of the nonlinear guidance
method is demonstrated when the unmanned

air vehicle is following circular paths. The adaptive nature of the
guidance method makes its stability independent of

vehicle velocity. The stability analysis is also extended to show
robust stability of the guidance law in the presence of

saturated lateral acceleration, which is an inherent limitation of
flight vehicles. Flight tests of the algorithm, using two

small unmanned air vehicles, showed that each aircraft was controlled
to within 1.6 m root mean square when

following circular paths. The method was used to perform a rendezvous
of the two aircraft, bringing them into very

close proximity, within 12 m of along track separation and 1.4 m root
mean square relative position errors.},

In the recent literature, a simple model for this kind of systems has been successfully used for control design. Such a model has been justified by measured data collected in experimental tests. Here, a similar model is derived, providing a theoretical analysis that gives an explicit link between the model equations and the physical parameters of the system. Moreover, a novel control approach to obtain figure-eight crosswind trajectories is presented. Contrary to most existing approaches, the proposed technique does not require a measurement of the wind velocity or of the apparent wind at the wing's location. The effectiveness of the approach is shown through hardware-in-the-loop tests and experimental results on a small scale prototype.},

control laws are each investigated separately. Conventional time-optimal
control theory is adopted taking into account the gyroscopic effect
embedded in the bias momentum spacecraft. The modal decomposition
technique is not applicable to gyroscopic systems due to the skew-symmetric
system matrix. Therefore, the analysis is conduced with physical
coordinates with extra effort in comparison with working with modal
coordinates. It turns out that the symmetric torque profile, which
is a necessary condition for the rest-to-rest maneuver of generic
structural systems, does not apply to gyroscopic systems. },

the starting state and backward from the end state until the two
trees are connected (bidirectional algorithm). The algorithms is

	Abstract = {In this paper, we use computer vision as a feedback sensor in a control
loop

for landing an unmanned air vehicle (UAV) on a landing pad. The vision

problem we address here is then a special case of the classic ego-motion

estimation problem since all feature points lie on a planar surface
(the landing

pad). We study together the discrete and differential versions of
the ego-motion

estimation, in order to obtain both position and velocity of the UAV
relative to

the landing pad. After briefly reviewing existing algorithm for the
discrete case,

we present, in a unified geometric framework, a new estimation scheme
for

solving the differential case. We further show how the obtained algorithms

enable the vision sensor to be placed in the feedback loop as a state
observer for

landing control. These algorithms are linear, numerically robust,
and

computationally inexpensive hence suitable for real-time implementation.
We

present a thorough performance evaluation of the motion estimation
algorithms

under varying levels of image measurement noise, altitudes of the
camera above

the landing pad, and different camera motions relative to the landing
pad. A

landing controller is then designed for a full dynamic model of the
UAV. Using

geometric nonlinear control theory, the dynamics of the UAV are decoupled

into an inner system and outer system. The proposed control scheme
is then

based on the differential flatness of the outer system. For the overall
closed-loop

system, conditions are provided under which exponential stability
can be

guaranteed. In the closed-loop system, the controller is tightly coupled
with the

vision based state estimation and the only auxiliary sensor are accelerometers

for measuring acceleration of the UAV. Finally, we show through simulation

results that the designed vision-in-the-loop controller generates
stable landing

maneuvers even for large levels of image measurement noise. Experiments
on

a real UAV will be presented in future work.},

is performed using Gaussian process (GP) regression. A path planner
generates and selects paths based on energy eciency and eld exploration.

maximum takeoff weight. However, when in flight, many aircraft can
handle larger loads, but this capability is rarely exploited. The
possibility of using an aircraft cable system to lift large payloads
is studied in this paper. This concept has been studied previously
for single-aircraft, single-cable systems in some detail. The major
limitation of such systems is the need to fly very tight circles
at high-lift coefficients. This limits the size of the payload that
can be retrieved with such a system. To overcome this, it is possible
to employ a multiple-aircraft, multiple-cable system to allow greater
control of the payload position as well as allowing a much wider
choice of aircraft speed and lift coefficient. In this paper, an
object-oriented cable modeling approach is used to study the relative
equilibria of such a system. Parametric studies of different payload
masses and aircraft orbit parameters are presented, and the dynamic
stability is analyzed. Collision-free transition trajectories that
take the multiple-aircraft system from circular flight into straight

In this paper, we develop a test-bed of three ground
robots, which are equipped with wheel encoders and
omnidirectional cameras, to implement the bearing-only
cooperative localization. The simulation and experimental
results validate the observability conditions, derived
in [1], for the complete observability of the bearing-only

	Abstract = {Abstract: The displacement of a calibrated camera between two images of a planar objectcan be estimated by decomposing a homography matrix. The aim of this document is topropose a new method for solving the homography decomposition problem. This new methodprovides analytical expressions for the solutions of the problem, instead of the traditionalnumerical procedures. As a result, expressions of the translation vector, rotation matrix andobject-plane normal are explicitly expressed as a function of the entries of the homographymatrix. The main advantage of this method is that it will provide a deeper understandingon the homography decomposition problem. For instance, it allows to obtain the relationsamong the possible solutions of the problem. Thus, new vision-based robot control laws canbe designed. For example the control schemes proposed in this report combine the two finalsolutions of the problem (only one of them being the true one) assuming that there is no apriori knowledge for discerning among them.},

Passivity, Linear Matrix Inequalities, Flexible Beam Comments: The
so-called smart structures frequently have more sensors than actuators,
due to the lower cost and simpler instumentation. The passivity based
controller, which is frequently used in structural control due to
its inherent robustness properties, requires sensor-actuator collocation;
therefore, it can at best utilize only a subset of the sensors. This
paper considers the design of a `squaring down' matrix which would
render a system passive subject to some aditional performance considerations.
This problem is cast as a set of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs)
which can be efficiently solved due to the recent advance in interior
point methods in convex programming. We applied this procedure with
the assumption that the sensors provide displcement as well as velocity
information which is generally not true. We show that the proposed
scheme can be implemented without the use of such velocity information.

	Abstract = { Johnny Evers vision of how biology should help in MAV airframe design,
and navigation, guidance, and control.

The ease with which flying insects, birds and bats negotiate confined,
obstacle-cluttered airspace has long inspired us with visions of
human-designed aerial machines with similar performance. Flying animals
exhibit capabilities for aerial acrobatics, insensitivity to wind
gusts, avoiding collision with or intercepting fixed and moving objects,
landing and take off from small perches, and numerous other feats
of flight agility that are beyond those of human-engineered vehicles.
Although we are naturally tempted to look to biological organisms
for inspiration or as design templates, the performance of the resulting
bio-inspired or biomimetic engineered devices rarely approaches that
of the living organisms. Among several possible reasons for this,
two important issues motivate and provide a focus for this paper:
it is nearly impossible to correlate biological processes with engineering
design principles; biological systems possess sensing-computationactuation
response architectures and processes that appear to differ from those
of engineered systems in fundamental ways, those differences are
poorly understood and their importance little appreciated. These
issues provide rich opportunities for research to produce genuine
advancements in our understanding of biological and artificial autonomy.
The research will necessarily involve biologists, engineers, and
mathematicians. As with any research endeavor involving multiple
mature disciplines, long term research collaborations are necessary
for establishing the foundation of fundamentally new science. Unfortunately,
without an objective understanding of these two issues and their
implications for guiding autonomous air vehicle research and development,
the real promise for biology-inspired or biomimetic concepts to achieve
breakthroughs in vehicle capabilities may remain an elusive dream.

	Abstract = { As unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are considered for a wider variety
of military and commercial applications, the ability to navigate
autonomously in unknown and hazardous environments is increasingly
vital to the effectiveness of UAVs. Reliable and efficient obstacle
detection is a fundamental prerequisite to performing autonomous
navigation in an unknown environment. Traditional two-dimensional
(planar) obstacle detection techniques, though computationally friendly,
are often insufficient for safe navigation through complex environments
in which commanded trajectories are restricted vertically by overhanging
obstacles or increases in terrain elevation. To this end, a pan/tilt-mounted
laser rangefinder is explored as a means of identifying and characterizing
potential obstacles in three dimensions (3D). From GPS position data
and inertial sensor measurements, the filtered laser rangefinder
data are transformed into local inertial coordinates and compiled
into a dynamic three-dimensional grid-based mapping of the specified
domain. The Georgia Tech GTMax UAV helicopter and simulation environment
provide a suitable test-bed for verification of the proposed obstacle
detection methodology. },

We show that the classical gated nearest neighbor approach, which considers each matching between sensor observations and features independently, ignores the fact that measurement prediction errors are correlated. This leads to easily accepting incorrect matchings when clutter or vehicle errors increase. We propose a new measurement of the joint compatibility of a set of pairings that successfully rejects spurious matchings. We show experimentally that this restrictive criterion can be used to efficiently search for the best solution to data association. Unlike the nearest neighbor, this method provides a robust solution in complex situations, such as cluttered environments or when revisiting previously mapped regions},

Existing fixed-wing traffic corridors are modeled as impenetrable obstacles.

The second task was to model and integrate wind data for complex urban flows into this simulation.

asymptotically stabilizing feedback control laws for the complete

use of a Lyapunov function, which involves the sum of a quadratic
term in the angular velocities and a logarithmic term in the kinematick
paramether, leads to th design of linear controllers. We also show
that the feedback control laws for the kinematics minimize a quadratic
cost in the state and control variable for all initial conditions.
For the complete system, we consturct a family of exponentially stabilizing
control laws and we investigate their optimality characteristics.
The proposed control laws are given in terms of the classical Cayley-Rodrigues

	Abstract = {The central task of GPS/INS integration is to effectively blend GPS
and INS data together

to generate an optimal solution. The present data fusion algorithms,
which are mostly based

on Kalman filtering (KF), have several limitations. One of those limitations
is the stringent

requirement on precise a priori knowledge of the system models and
noise properties.

Uncertainty in the covariance parameters of the process noise (Q)
and the observation

errors (R) may significantly degrade the filtering performance. The
conventional way of

determining Q and R relies on intensive analysis of empirical data.
However, the noise levels

may change in different applications. Over the past few decades adaptive
KF algorithms

have been intensively investigated with a view to reducing the influence
of the Q and R

definition errors. The covariance matching method has been shown to
be one of the most

promising techniques. This paper first investigates the utilization
of an online stochastic

modelling algorithm with regards to its parameter estimation stability,
convergence, optimal

window size, and the interaction between Q and R estimations. Then
a new adaptive process

noise scaling algorithm is proposed. Without artificial or empirical
parameters being used,

the proposed adaptive mechanism has demonstrated the capability of
autonomously tuning

the process noise covariance to the optimal magnitude, and hence improving
the overall

filtering performance.},

	Abstract = {Abstract---In this paper the problem of localize two mobile robots is considered. The robots are equipped with proprioceptive sensors (like encoders) and exteroceptive sensors able to provide relative observations between them. In these observations, one robot detects and identifies the other one and measures some relative quantity. An observability analysis is performed by taking into account the system nonlinearities and for four different relative observations. The theoretical results are validated by simulations and experiments carried out on real platforms. In these experiments, an Extended Kalman Filter is adopted to fuse the information coming from the encoders and the sensors performing the observations. My comments-- This paper provides a nonlinear analysis of observability for relative robot kinematics. It should be of interest to David Wheeler's work. The paper is not very clear in the fact that the input variable is not included in the observability analysis. If the input variable is a function of x, then it should impact the observability analysis. In essense the paper only considers the case when the inputs are constant.},

MILP Comments: This paper describes methods for optimizing the task
allocation problem for a fleet of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)
with tightly coupled tasks and rigid relative timing constraints.
The overall objective is to minimize the mission completion time
for the fleet, and the task assignment must account for differing
UAV capabilities and no-fly zones. Loitering times are included as
extra degrees of freedom in the problem to help meet the timing constraints.
The overall problem is formulated using mixed-integer linear programming
(MILP), which gives the globally optimal solution. An approximate
decomposition solution method is also used to overcome the computational
issues that arise when using MILP for larger problems. The problem
is also posed in a way that can be solved using Tabu search. This
approach is demonstrated to provide good solutions in reasonable
computation times for large problems that are very difficult to solve
using the exact or approximate decomposition methods. },

	Abstract = { Location: ref DB 1 Keywords: Inverse Optimal Control, linear quadratic
regulator Comments: The purpose of this paper is to formulate, study,
and resolve the inverse problem of optimal control theory, which
is the following: Given a control law, find all performance indices
for which this control law is optimal.

Under the assumptions of (a) linear constant plant, (b) linear constant
control law, (c) measurable state vvariables, (d) quadratic loss
functions with constant coefficients, (e) single control variable,
we give a complete analysis of this problem and obtain various explicit
conditions for the optimality of a given control law. An interesting
feature of the analysis is the central role of frequency-domain concepts,
which have been ignored in optimal control theory until very recently.
The discussion is presented in rigorous mathematical form.

The central conclusion is the following: A stable control law is
optimal if and only if the absolute value of the corresponding return
difference is at least equal to one at all frequencies. This provides
a beautifully simple connecting link between modern control theory
and the classical point of view which regards feedback as a means
of reducing component variations. },

	Abstract = {Abstract---Many autonomous platforms, such as micro airvehicles,
are increasingly relying on cheap, lightweight sensors
to improve the low-level state estimation for navigation and
control. Unfortunately, these and all sensors have a finite
probability of returning spurious measurements that do not
follow the classical zero-mean Gaussian models of measurement
noise. A classical heuristic used to mitigate the effects of sensor
faults is the gated-Kalman filter. We show that the gated-
Kalman filter estimate diverges from the true states when
the probability of detection is low or when the measurement
noise standard deviation increases above the expected value.
The main contribution of this paper is to utilize the recently
developed recursive-RANSAC algorithm in a feedback loop to
robustly estimate the true states when the probability of a
sensor fault is high, when the measurement noise characteristics
abruptly change, and during brief occlusions of the true signal,
while maintaining real-time performance.},

	Abstract = { Keywords: optical flow structure from motion Comments: Several novel
structure from motion algorithms are presented which are designed
to more effectively manage the problem of noise. In many practical
applications, structure from motion algorithms fail to work properly
because of the noise in the optical flow values. Most structure from
motion algorithms implicitly assume that the noise is identically-distributed
and that the noise is white. Both assumptions are false. Some points
are easier to track than others and some points are easier to track
in a particular direction. The accuracy of each optical flow value
can be quantified using an optical flow probability distribution.
By using optical flow probability distributions in place of optical
flow estimates in a structure from motion algorithm, a better understanding
of the noise is developed and a more accurate solution is obtained.
Two different methods of calculating the optical flow probability
distributions are presented. The first calculates non-Gaussian probability
distributions and the second calculates Gaussian probability distributions.
Three different methods for calculating structure from motion are
presented which use these probability distributions. The first method
works on two frames and can handle any kind of noise. The second
method works on two frames and is restricted to only Gaussian noise.
The final method works on multiple frames and uses Gaussian noise.
A simulation was created to directly compare the performance of methods
which use optical flow probability distributions and methods which
do not. The simulation results show that those methods which use
the probability distributions better estimate the camera motion and
the structure of the scene. },

	Abstract = {Vision is arguably the most widely used sensor for position and velocity estimation in animals, and it is increasingly used in robotic systems as well. Many animals use stereopsis and object recognition in order to make a true estimate of distance. For a tiny insect such as a fruit fly or honeybee, however, these methods fall short. Instead, an insect must rely on calculations of optic flow, which can provide a measure of the ratio of velocity to distance, but not either parameter independently. Nevertheless, flies and other insects are adept at landing on a variety of substrates, a behavior that inherently requires some form of distance estimation in order to trigger distance-appropriate motor actions such as deceleration or leg extension. Previous studies have shown that these behaviors are indeed under visual control, raising the question: how does an insect estimate distance solely using optic flow? In this paper we use a nonlinear control theoretic approach to propose a solution for this problem. Our algorithm takes advantage of visually controlled landing trajectories that have been observed in flies and honeybees. Finally, we implement our algorithm, which we term dynamic peering, using a camera mounted to a linear stage to demonstrate its real-world feasibility.},

Comments: This paper investigates the problem of robust H-infinity
output feedback control for nonlinear systems with time-varying parameter
uncertainty satisfying some integral functional constrains. We address
the problem of designing a compensator such that the L2-gain of the
mapping from the exogenous input noise to the penalty output is minimized
or guaranteed to be less than or equal to a prescribed value. We
establish the interconnection between the robust nonlinear H-infinity
control problem and the nonlinear H-infinity control problem. Based
on this connection, a sufficient condition for the existence of a
solution to the robust nonlinear H-infinity output feedback control
problem is derived in terms of a scaled Hamilton-Jacobi inequality.

This paper extends the standard nonlinear H{\_}$\backslash$infty result to systems
with structured uncertainty in the model. The result is that the
standard HJI equation is modified into another HJI equation that
reflects the uncertainty. },

The probability hypothesis density (PHD) filter is a recursion that propagates the posterior intensity function-a 1st-order moment-of the random set of multiple targets in time. Like the Bayesian single-target filter, the PHD recursion also suffers from the curse of dimensionality. Although sequential Monte Carlo implementations have demonstrated the potential of the PHD filter, so far no closed-form solutions have yet been developed. In this paper, an analytic solution to the PHD recursion is proposed for linear Gaussian target dynamics with Gaussian births.

@article{MoaseManzieBrear10,
	Abstract = {Abstract---In practice, the convergence rate and stability of perturbation
based extremum-seeking schemes can be very sensitive to the curvature
of the plant map. An example of this can be seen in the use of extremum-seeking
to reduce the amplitude of thermoacoustic oscillations in premixed,
gas-turbine combustors. This sensitivity to the plant map curvature
arises from the use of a gradient descent adaptation algorithm. Such
extremum-seeking schemes may need to be conservatively tuned in order
to maintain stability over a wide range of operating conditions,
resulting in slower optimization than could be achieved for a fixed
operating condition. This can severely reduce the effectiveness of
perturbation based extremum-seeking schemes in some applications.
In this paper, a sinusoidally perturbed extremum-seeking scheme using
a Newton-like step is developed. Non-local stability results for
the scheme are formulated using a Lyapunov analysis. A local analysis
of the scheme is given to investigate the influence of plant dynamics
and to show that the local rate of convergence is independent of
the plant map curvature. The benefit of this plant map curvature
independence is then experimentally demonstrated in minimizing the
thermoacoustic oscillations in a model premixed combustor.},

	Abstract = {An adaptive position-tracking control scheme is proposed for vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) unmanned airborne vehicles (UAVs) for a set of bounded external disturbances. The control design is achieved in three main steps. The first step is devoted to the design of an a priori bounded linear acceleration driving the translational dynamics toward the desired trajectory. In the second step, we extract the required a priori bounded thrust and the desired attitude, in terms of unit quaternion, from the desired acceleration derived in the first step. In the last step, we design the required torque for the rotational dynamics, allowing the system{\&}{\#}x2019;s attitude to be driven toward the desired attitude obtained at the second step. Two control laws for the system control torque are rigorously designed. The first control law ensures that the position-tracking objective is satisfied for any initial conditions, whereas the second ensures that the tracking objective is satisfied for a set of initial conditions, which is dependant on the control gains. The latter case is included, since it is less complicated than the former control law and may be advantageous from a practical point of view. Finally, simulation results are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy.},

	Abstract = {Abstract Dynamic stall on a helicopter rotor blade comprises

a series of complex aerodynamic phenomena in

response to the unsteady change of the blade's angle of

attack. It is accompanied by a lift overshoot and delayed

massive flow separation with respect to static stall. The

classical hallmark of the dynamic stall phenomenon is the

dynamic stall vortex. The flow over an oscillating OA209

airfoil under dynamic stall conditions was investigated by

means of unsteady surface pressure measurements and timeresolved

particle image velocimetry. The characteristic

features of the unsteady flow field were identified and

analysed utilising different coherent structure identification

methods. An Eulerian and a Lagrangian procedure were

adopted to locate the axes of vortices and the edges of

Lagrangian coherent structures, respectively; a proper

orthogonal decomposition of the velocity field revealed the

energetically dominant coherent flow patterns and their

temporal evolution. Based on the complementary information

obtained by these methods the dynamics and interaction

of vortical structures were analysed within a single dynamic

stall life cycle leading to a classification of the unsteady

flow development into five successive stages: the attached

flow stage; the stall development stage; stall onset; the

stalled stage; and flow reattachment. The onset of dynamic

stall was specified here based on a characteristic mode of

the proper orthogonal decomposition of the velocity field.

Variations in the flow field topology that accompany the

stall onset were verified by the Lagrangian coherent structure

analysis. The instantaneous effective unsteadiness was

defined as a single representative parameter to describe the

influence of the motion parameters. Dynamic stall onset was

found to be promoted by increasing unsteadiness. The

mechanism that results in the detachment of the dynamic

stall vortex from the airfoil was identified as vortex-induced

separation caused by strong viscous interactions. Finally, a

revised criterion to discern between light and deep dynamic

stall was formulated.},

behaviors for groups of identical mobile agents. The approach
is based on decentralized simultaneous estimation and control,
where each agent communicates with neighbors and estimates
the global performance properties of the swarm needed to make
a local control decision. Challenges of the approach include
designing a control law with desired convergence properties,
assuming each agent has perfect global knowledge; designing an
estimator that allows each agent to make correct estimates of
the global properties needed to implement the controller; and
possibly modifying the controller to recover desired convergence
properties when using the estimates of global performance. We
apply this framework to the problem of controlling the moment
statistics describing the location and shape of a swarm. We derive
conditions which guarantee that the formation statistics are driven
to desired values, even in the presence of a changing network

UAVs systems have been proposed for a wide range of applications such as mapping, surveillance, search, and tracking operations. The recent availability of low-cost UAVs suggests the use of teams of vehicles to perform sensing tasks. To leverage the capabilities of a team of vehicles, efficient methods of decentralized sensing and cooperative path planning are necessary. The goal of this work is to examine practical control strategies for a team of fixed-wing vehicles performing cooperative sensing. We seek to develop decentralized, autonomous control strategies that can account for a wide variety of sensing missions. Sensing goals are posed from an information theoretic standpoint to design strategies that explicitly minimize uncertainty. This work proposes a tightly coupled approach, in which sensor models and estimation objectives are used online for path planning.},

act as mechanical carriers of data. The mobile element, which is

Systems, Infinite Dimensional Linear systems Comments: Control of
the distributed parameter systems (DPS) usually involves dynamical
descriptions on infinite-dimensional Hilbert or Banach spaces of
functions. For a linear stabilizable and detectable DPS, an infintie-dimesional
feedback controller exists so that the closed-loop system is stable.
However, this infinite-dimensional controller generally cannot be
implemented with practical computers and devices. Consequently, the
reduced order modeling of DPS becomes extremely crucial for finite-dimensional
controller design. In this thesis, Galerkin (or finite element) mehtods
are presented as a way to develop finite-dimensional Galerkin controllers
by approximating the infinite-dimensional stabilizing controller
for a class of linear DPS. This investigation will give a very simple
sufficient condition, i.e. the test of nonsingularity of a matrix
for a finite-dimensional Galerkin feedback controller to perform
as well as the infinite-dimensional stabilizing controller. },

Rather, a set of underdetermined task functions are developedto regulate the mean and variance of a set of image features. Regulatingthese task functions inhibits feature points from leaving the camera FOV.An additional task function is used to maintain a high level of motionperceptibility, which ensures that desired feature point velocities can beachieved. These task functions are mapped to camera velocity, which servesas the system input. A proof of stability is presented for tracking three orfewer targets. Experiments of tracking eight or more targets have verifiedthe performance of the proposed method.},

multiple mobile robots with manipulators focusing on tasks that require
grasping, manipulation and transporting large and possibly flexible

are realized through sensing and communication. The robots can
cooperatively transport objects and march in a tightly controlled
formation, while also having the capability to navigate autonomously. We
describe the key aspects of the overall hierarchy and the basic
algorithms, with specific applications to our experimental testbed
consisting of three robots. We describe results from many experiments

large boxes as well as the system's robustness to alignment and odometry

a leader-following approach to the platoon problem in intelligent

the approach is not decentralized in the same sense as we are using.
The velocity and acceleration of the platoon leader are communicated
to each vehicle. Each vehicle the responds based on the its own state
(position, velocity, and acceleration) and the state of the vehicle
in front of it. The coordination variable is the velocity and acceleration
variable of the leader and the state of the vehicle in front, a sort
of combination of standard leader following and the behavioral approach.
As an interesting note, the authors claim that there are two important
aspects for this type of design: (1) the graph of the interconnection
(a lot of attention in formation flying) and (2) the time-scale separation
in the dynamics (very little attention in formation control). },

@article{Thrun2008,
	Abstract = {This chapter provides a comprehensive intro- duction in to the simultaneous localization and mapping problem, better known in its abbrevi- ated form as SLAM. SLAM addresses the problem of a robot navigating an unknown environment. While navigating the environment, the robot seeks to acquire a map thereof, and at the same time it wishes to localize itself using its map. The use of SLAM problems can be motivated in two different ways: one might be interested in detailed envi- ronment models, or one might seek to maintain an accurate sense of a mobile robot's location. SLAM serves both of these purposes. We review three major paradigms of algorithms from which a huge number of recently published methods are derived. First comes the traditional approach, which relies on the extended Kalman filter (EKF) for representing the robot's best es- timate. The second paradigm draws its intuition from the fact that the SLAM problem can be viewed as a sparse graph of constraints, and it applies nonlinear optimization for recovering the map and the robot's locations. Finally, we survey the particle filter paradigm, which applies nonparametric density estimation and efficient factorization methods to the SLAM problem. This chapter dis- cusses extensions of these basic methods. It elucidates variants of the SLAM problem and proposes a taxonomy for the field. Relevant re- search is referenced extensively, and open research problems are discussed.},

	Abstract = {The displacement of a calibrated camera between two images of a planar object can be estimated by decomposing a homography matrix. The aim of this document is to propose a newmethod for solving the homography decomposition problem. This newmethod provides analytical expressions for the solutions of the problem, instead of the traditional numerical procedures. As a result, expressions of the translation vector, rotation matrix and object-plane normal are explicitly expressed as a function of the entries of the homography matrix. The main advantage of this method is that it will provide a deeper understanding on the homography decomposition problem. For instance, it allows to obtain the relations among the possible solutions of the problem. Thus, new vision-based robot control laws can be designed. For example the control schemes proposed in this report combine the two final solutions of the problem (only one of them being the true one) assuming that there is no a priori knowledge for discerning among them.},

This paper describes an adaptive control scheme for tracking heading,

two parts: an inner-loop controller for roll rate, pitch rate, and
yaw rate, and an outer loop controller for heading, altitude, velocity,
and side-slip angle. The inner loop controller accounts for unknown
trim conditions and is adaptive. The outer loop loop controller is
not adaptive. The adaptive controller is a continuous-time model
reference adaptive controller that uses a stabilized recursive least-squares
algorithm to estimate the parameters. Stability and convergence is
not analyzed. Simulation results on an F-16 model are presented.

formation flying UAVs Dijkstra's algorithm fault reconfiguration
communication leader-following behavioral scheme (kinda) distributed
Comments: This paper discusses close formation flight for multiple
UAV's, and possibly manned vehicles. The main focus of the paper
is on reconfiguring the communication channels between aircraft.
The dynamics assumed for the aircraft are linearized lateral and
longitudinal dynamics about trim conditions. An autopilot is designed
using LQR techniques. Similar to our current approach, the inputs
to the autopilot are velocity, altitude and heading commands. The
formation controller is a leader following scheme that uses LQ controllers
to track the trajectory of the leader. The leader following scheme
can also be adjusted slightly to accommadate the relative position
of other aircraft. The communication channels are configured using
Dijkstra's algorithm to choose optimal, and suboptimal backup, links.
Three types of communcation faults are discussed: Aircraft loss,
transmitter failure, and receiver failure. Ad hoc, but deterministic
(i.e., pre-programmed) schemes are persented deal with each of these
failures. While distributed, the resolution to these faults does
not constitute coordinated behavior. },

	Abstract = {The application of multivariable adaptive control techniques to flight
control reconfiguration is considered. The objective is to redesign
automatically flight control laws to compensate for actuator failures
or surface damage. Three adaptive algorithms for multivariable model
reference control are compared. The availability of state measurements
in this application leads to relatively simple algorithms. The respective
advantages and disadvantages of the adaptive algorithms are discussed,
considering their complexity and the assumptions that they require.
An equation-error based algorithm is found to be preferable. Simulations
obtained using a full nonlinear model of a twinengine jet aircraft
are presented. The results demonstrate the ability of the adaptive
algorithms to maintain trim after a failure, to restore tracking
of the pilot commands despite the loss of actuator effectiveness,
and to coordinate the use of the remaining active control surfaces
in order to guarantee the decoupling of the rotational axes. A new
adaptive algorithm with a variable forgetting feature is also used
and is found to yield a useful alternative to covariance resetting
as a solution to covariance wind-up in least-squares algorithms.},

The optimization procedure is based on predictions made by linearized incremental models at points of a given seed trajectory and the effects of linearization error are taken into account to give a bound on the predicted tracking error. The algorithm is posed in the form of an LP and the proper selection of the terminal penalty term of the predicted cost guarantees the asymptotic stability.

	Abstract = { Numerous applications require aerial surveillance. Civilian applications
include monitoring forest fires, oil fields, and pipelines and tracking
wildlife. Applications to homeland security include border patrol
and monitoring the perimeter of nuclear power plants. Military applications
are numerous. The current approach to these applications is to use
a single manned vehicle for surveillance. However, manned vehicles
are typically large and expensive. In addition, hazardous environments
and operator fatigue can potentially threaten the life of the pilot.
Therefore, there is a critical need for automating aerial surveillance
using unmanned air vehicles (UAVs). This paper gives an overview
of a cooperative control strategy for aerial surveillance that has
been successfully flight tested on small (48-in wingspan) UAVs. Our
approach to cooperative control problems can be summarized in four
steps: 1) the definition of a cooperation constraint and cooperation
objective; 2) the definition of a coordination variable as the minimal
amount of information needed to effect cooperation; 3) the design
of a centralized cooperation strategy; and 4) the use of consensus
schemes to transform the centralized strategy into a decentralized
algorithm. The effectiveness of the solution will be shown using
both highfidelity simulation and actual flight tests. },

	Abstract = {  Consensus algorithms for networked dynamic systems provide scalable algorithms for sensor fusion in sensor networks. This paper introduces a distributed filter that allows the nodes of a sensor network to track the average of n sensor measurements using an average consensus based distributed filter called consensus filter. This consensus filter plays a crucial role in solving a data fusion problem that allows implementation of a scheme for distributed Kalman filtering in sensor networks. The analysis of the convergence, noise propagation reduction, and ability to track fast signals are provided for consensus filters. As a byproduct, a novel critical phenomenon is found that relates the size of a sensor network to its tracking and sensor fusion capabilities. We characterize this performance limitation as a tracking uncertainty principle. This answers a fundamental question regarding how large a sensor network must be for effective sensor fusion. Moreover, regular networks emerge as efficient topologies for distributed fusion of noisy information. Though, arbitrary overlay networks can be used. Simulation results are provided that demonstrate the effectiveness of consensus filters for distributed sensor fusion. },

the gravitational inertial direction extracted from image features

assumes that the commanded trajectory is feasible within the velocity
constraints. Tracking errors converge to zero exponentially, but

algorithm, (3) compute structure from motion (4) use feature points
to learn a world map, which is represented using a quad tree. (5)
develop a finite set of possible maneuvers (6) use model predictive
control to select maneuvers that transition through the world map.

approach to the problem of coordinating multiple robots to move a
number of pucks to a goal location. The basic idea is to divide the
area into equal rectangular rectangles and then have robots move
the pucks in their territory to the neighboring territory that is
closest to the goal. The control strategy is based on Rodney Brook's
subsumption architecture. The paper provides a nice literature review
of related work. Performance is quantified in terms of achieving
the goal and also the amount of inter-robot interference that is
induced. The authors make the point that 'adaptive group behavior
is a balance between minimizing interference and maximizing synergy
(goal achievement at the group level).'},

	Abstract = {The application range of UAVs (unmanned aerial vehicles) is expanding along with performance upgrades. Vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) aircraft has the merits of both fixed-wing and rotary-wing aircraft. Tail-sitting is the simplest way for the VTOL maneuver since it does not need extra actuators. However, conventional hovering control for a tail-sitter UAV is not robust enough against large disturbance such as a blast of wind, a bird strike, and so on. It is experimentally observed that the conventional quaternion feedback hovering control often fails to keep stability when the control compensates large attitude errors. This paper proposes a novel hovering control strategy for a tail-sitter VTOL UAV that increases stability against large disturbance. In order to verify the proposed hovering control strategy, simulations and experiments on hovering of the UAV are performed giving large attitude errors. The results show that the proposed control strategy successfully compensates initial large attitude errors keeping stability, while the conventional quaternion feedback controller fails. 2010 IEEE.},

In cooperative control, each system is endowed with its own state variable and dynamics. A fundamental problem in multi-agent dynamical systems on networks is the design of distributed protocols that guarantee consensus or synchronization in the sense that the states of all the systems reach the same value. The states could represent vehicle headings or posi- tions, estimates of sensor readings in a sensor network, oscillation frequencies, trust opinions of each agent, and so on. In multi-agent systems, all systems should agree on},

rugulator for nonlinear systems with respect to variations in gain
is investigated. It is shown that there exists regulators that produce
asymptotically stable closed-loop systems, but do not tolerate any
variation in gain without instability. However, if the linearized
closed-loop system is also asymptotically stable, then there is always
some gain margin. For a wide class of optimal regulators, it is shown
that the gain margin is infinite with respect to increases in the
gain and that decreases down to 0.5 can be tolerated. The robustness
properties of linear quadratic control laws are thus generalized.

	Abstract = {Under appropriate conditions, the dynamics of a control system governed
by ordinary di{\textregistered}erential

equations can be formulated several ways: di{\textregistered}erential inclusion, control
parameterization, $\,^{\circ}$atness

parameterization, higher-order inclusions and so on. A plethora of
techniques have been proposed

for each of these formulations but they are typically not portable
across equivalent mathematical

formulations. Further complications arise as a result of conÂ¯guration
and control constraints such

as those imposed by obstacle avoidance or control saturation. In this
paper, we present a uniÂ¯ed

framework for handling the computation of optimal controls where the
description of the governing

equations or that of the path constraint is not a limitation. In fact,
our method exploits the advantages

o{\textregistered}ered by coordinate transformations and harnesses any inherent smoothness
present in the optimal

system trajectories. We demonstrate how our computational framework
can easily and e$\pm$ciently

handle di{\textregistered}erent cost formulations, control sets and path constraints.
We illustrate our ideas by

formulating a robotics problem eight di{\textregistered}erent ways that includes a
di{\textregistered}erentially $\,^{\circ}$at formulation

subject to control saturation. This example establishes the loss of
convexity in the $\,^{\circ}$at formulation

as well as its ramiÂ¯cations on computation and optimality. In addition,
a numerical comparison of

our uniÂ¯ed approach to a recent technique tailored for control-a$\pm$ne
systems reveals that we get

about 30{\%} improvement in the performance index.},

calculation in networks where communications between nodes

are corrupted by additive noise. Specifically, given a fixed

network where each node has some given initial value, and

under the constraint that each node receives noisy transmissions

only from its immediate neighbors, we provide a distributed

scheme for any node to calculate an unbiased estimate of an

arbitrary linear function of the initial values. Our scheme

consists of a linear iteration where, at each time-step, each

node updates its value to be a weighted average of its own

previous value and those of its neighbors. We show that after

repeating this process with almost any set of weights for a

finite number of time-steps (upper bounded by the size of the

network), any node in the network will be able to calculate

an unbiased estimate of any linear function by taking a linear

combination of the values that it sees over the course of the

linear iteration. Furthermore, for a given set of weights, we

describe how to choose this linear combination to minimize

the variance of the unbiased estimate calculated by each node.

A special case of our results is a solution to the distributed

consensus problem, where each node has to obtain an unbiased

estimate of the same linear function.},

enables them to benefit from wind profiles

that may be unfavorable to inhabited aircraft. This paper examines
optimal uninhabited aerial vehicle flights that

can extract energy from downdrafts for enhancing endurance. Uninhabited
aerial vehicle motions are described by a

point-mass dynamic model. A downdraft wind field is modeled by a pair
of three-dimensional vortex rings placed

symmetrically with respect to the ground. Fundamental dimensionless
parameters that affect uninhabited aerial

vehicle behaviors in a downdraft are identified through the normalization
of the equations and wind expressions.

Uninhabited aerial vehicle flight through a downdraft is formulated
as a nonlinear optimal control problem that

minimizes the average thrust or power per unit time. Vehicle performance
and operational limits are enforced

through boundary conditions and path constraints. These optimal control
problems are converted into parameter

optimization problems with a collocation method and solved numerically
using the sparse parameter optimization

software SNOPT. Numerical solutions systematically obtained for a
range of dimensionless parameters reveal four

basic patterns of optimal uninhabited aerial vehicle flights through
a downdraft in the vertical plane. Results

demonstrate that traditional definitions of favorable winds may need
to be revised for uninhabited aerial vehicles.},

The methods are applicable to general nonlinear and non-Gaussian models for the target dynamics and measurement likelihood. We provide efficient solutions to two very pertinent problems: the data association problem that arises due to unlabelled measurements in the presence of clutter, and the curse of dimensionality that arises due to the increased size of the state-space associated with multiple targets. We develop a number of algorithms to achieve this. The first, which we refer to as the Monte Carlo joint probabilistic data association filter (MC-JPDAF), is a generalisation of the strategy proposed in [1] and [2]. As is the case for the JPDAF, the distributions of interest are the marginal filtering distributions for each of the targets, but these are approximated with particles rather than Gaussians. We also develop two extensions to the standard particle filtering methodology for tracking multiple targets. The first, which we refer to as the sequential sampling particle filter (SSPF), samples the individual targets sequentially by utilising a factorisation of the importance weights. The second, which we refer to as the independent partition particle filter (IPPF), assumes the associations to be independent over the individual targets, leading to an efficient component-wise sampling strategy to construct new particles. We evaluate and compare the proposed methods on a challenging synthetic tracking problem.},

Also this method does not require excessive online computations like
the recently popular state dependent Riccati equation (SDRE) technique.
Furthermore, it provides a closed-form non-linear feedback controller

In my oppinion, this is a very substantial paper. The basic idea
is to cascade an Euler-Lagrange system (control) with the plant,
also modelled as an EL system, to obtain a larger EL system. EL systems
are passive systems, and so if you make the controller dissipative,
the closed loop system will be globally asymptotically stable. There
are many advantages, including the fact that only output feedback
is required. Also, there are extensions to input saturation constraints.

control design are to prevent an electric power system losing synchronism
after a large sudden fault and to achieve good postfault regulation
of the generator terminal voltage. Important control ideas used to
improve the transient stability of the power system are to rapidly
increase excitation and to decrease the mechanical input power at
the same time as a fault occurs. In this paper, we concentrate our
attention on power systems after a symmetrical 3-phase short circuit
fault. By using the direct feedback linearization technique, a novel
excitation controller and coordinated controller are given. The simulation
results show that the power system can keep transiently stable and
achieve good postfault voltage regulation with the nonlinear controllers.
Thus they have prospects for an industrial application. },

ultrasonic sensors provide a viable alternative and are light

enough to mount on a MAV. However, each of these sensors

	Abstract = {Abstract---Learning models of the environment is one of the

fundamental tasks of mobile robots since maps are needed for a

wide range of robotic applications, such as navigation and transportation

tasks, service robotic applications, and several others.

In the past, numerous efficient approaches to map learning have

been proposed.Most of them, however, assume that the robot lives

on a plane. In this paper, we present a highly efficient maximumlikelihood

approach that is able to solve 3-D and 2-D problems.

Our approach addresses the so-called graph-based formulation of

simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) and can be seen as

an extension of Olson's algorithm toward non-flat environments.

It applies a novel parameterization of the nodes of the graph that

significantly improves the performance of the algorithm and can

cope with arbitrary network topologies. The latter allows us to

bound the complexity of the algorithm to the size of the mapped

area and not to the length of the trajectory. Furthermore, our

approach is able to appropriately distribute the roll, pitch, and

yaw error over a sequence of poses in 3-D mapping problems. We

implemented our technique and compared it with multiple other

graph-based SLAM solutions. As we demonstrate in simulated

and real-world experiments, our method converges faster than the

other approaches and yields accurate maps of the environment.},

are used to model the dynamics and this allows some interesting computations.
The resulting control law has two parts, (1) a matching term that
causes the group centroid to match the velocity of the reference,
and (2) a spacing term that keeps the vehicles close to the centroid.
As a result, the vehicles return the to the centroid on a periodic
basis. The result also produces vehicles that equally space themselves
around an orbit. However, the method can only handle three vehicles
at this point. },

and receive commands from a ground station. Data from several flight
tests were used to characterize the dynamic response of the aircraft
Despite the high level of noise associated with the low-cost sensor
suite, consistent identification of critical aircraft parameters
was obtained. Flight tests were also conducted with actuator failures
induced on one elevator, one aileron, and one engine. Recursive parameter
identification produced parameters tracking the effects of the failures,
such as reduced effectiveness of pitch commands due to a locked elevator,
or roll and sideslip due to engine failure. The identified parameters
were also used in reconfigurable control experiments, where knowledge
of the aircraft parameters was used to compensate for the effect
of failures, reducing the pilot's workload. Overall, the paper demonstrates
that recursive identification and reconfigurable control algorithms
are implementable in real-time, even in low-cost platforms. They
can be designed to effectively compensate for actuator failures and

trajectory tracking for ground based mobile robots. {\%} Localization
is used to mean localizing the robot in the surrounding environment.

Landmark based methods where a known landmark in the scene is used
to triangulate the position, and Natural Feature-based methods, where
natural features are tracked using stereo cameras to track differential
motion. {\%} An novel binary corner detection algorithm that is 1.6
times faster than a Harris corner detector is discussed. {\%} The corner
detector is used to reconstruct the 3-D world coordinates. Since
lenses lead to image warping, the image has to be unwarped. However,
the unwarping process can lead to strange artifacts in the unwarped
image. Instead of unwarping the image and then reconstructing the
3-D location, in this paper the features are tracked in the warped
image and then projected back through the unwarping process. {\%} Features
are tracked using a normalized mean-squared differences metric. {\%}
Motion is estimated using optic flow, which is found using least-squares
minimization. {\%} The position of the robot is tracked using a Kalman
filter. Also, the position of each feature is tracked using a seperate
Kalman filter for each feature. {\%} Experimental results are demonstrated

including scientific computing and computer graphics. An unstructured
simplex mesh requires a choice of meshpoints (vertex nodes) and a
triangulation. We want to offer a short and simple MATLAB code, described
in more detail than usual, so the reader can experiment (and add
to the code) knowing the underlying principles. We find the node
locations by solving for equilibrium in a truss structure (using
piecewise linear force-displacement relations) and we reset the topology
by the Delaunay algorithm. The geometry is described implicitly by

an active camera mounted on a pan-tilt platform. Ego motion is removed
so that static tracking algorithms can be applied. The equation for
apparent motion uses roll, pitch, and yaw angles instead of p, q,

the images to get those pixels that have changed, (3) mix that with
an edge detector so that you only pick out edgest that have moved.
(4) perform erosion and dilation to get rid of residual noise introduced

partition state space Comments: his paper develops the theory for
solving piecewise-linear optimal control problems and then employs
this theory to obtain suboptimal solutions for controlling non-linear
systems. The non-linear system is first approximated by a piecewise-linear
model. A jump condition on the adjoint variables and a continuity
condition on the Hamiltonian are derived and utilized to obtain the
optimal solution to the piecewise-linear model. This control is then
considered as a suboptimal solution to the non-linear problem.

The piecewise-linear modelling technique provides a means of decoupling
the system and adjoint equations and hence provides a simple means
of calculating the suboptimal control. A variable mass, minimum-energy
problem is solved to illustrate the technique. A feedback scheme
is introduced to minimize the boundary and cost errors. },

The optimization problem is formulated using a combination of the squared error and L1-norm objective functions.

scenario of interest is one where multiple microaerial vehicles

car model so that the vehicles' dynamic constraint of minimum
turning radius is taken into account. Due to the prohibitive
computational complexity of the coupled path optimization and
assignment problem, we solve the problem by ordering a set
of tasks based on the Euclidean distance, utilizing a traveling
salesman problem solver. We apply upper and lower bounding
procedures iteratively on active subsets within the set of feasible
group assignments, enabling efficient search of the solution space.
The online implementation of the algorithm is discussed and simulation results confirm the efficiency of the proposed algorithm.

	Abstract = {Abstract?We present a new parametrization for point features

within monocular simultaneous localization and mapping

(SLAM) that permits efficient and accurate representation of uncertainty

during undelayed initialization and beyond, all within

the standard extended Kalman filter (EKF). The key concept

is direct parametrization of the inverse depth of features relative

to the camera locations from which they were first viewed,

which produces measurement equations with a high degree of

linearity. Importantly, our parametrization can cope with features

over a huge range of depths, even those that are so far fromthe camera

that they present little parallax during motion?maintaining

sufficient representative uncertainty that these points retain the
opportunity

to ?come in? smoothly from infinity if the camera makes

larger movements. Feature initialization is undelayed in the sense

that even distant features are immediately used to improve camera

motion estimates, acting initially as bearing references but not

permanently labeled as such. The inverse depth parametrization

remains well behaved for features at all stages of SLAM processing,

but has the drawback in computational terms that each point is

represented by a 6-D state vector as opposed to the standard three

of a Euclidean XYZ representation. We show that once the depth

estimate of a feature is sufficiently accurate, its representation
can

safely be converted to the Euclidean XYZ form, and propose a

linearity index that allows automatic detection and conversion to

maintain maximum efficiency?only low parallax features need be

maintained in inverse depth form for long periods. We present a

real-time implementation at 30 Hz, where the parametrization is

validated in a fully automatic 3-D SLAM system featuring a handheld

single camera with no additional sensing. Experiments show

robust operation in challenging indoor and outdoor environments

with a very large ranges of scene depth, varied motion, and also

real time 360? loop closing.},

Some of the ideas include commercial scale electric turbines for the upper atmosphere, using tow devices to assist in shipping or portable light wind generators. Different from current turbines, these systems do not have large masts and blades but instead use a tethered flying body to transmit energy. The vehicle at the end of the tether varies depending on the energy harvesting method but all fall under the broader category of the towed body. In contrast to modeling and analysis techniques specifically tailored to evaluate performance of individual types of towed bodies, a methodology for designing efficient, stable wings for towed bodies is developed. Static performance can be characterized by a minimal set of design parameters. This minimal set is derived through dimensional analysis showing that the static performance is dependent on a minimum of 3 parameters. These are chosen to be the ratios of effective lift to drag of the end vehicle, tether cross-flow drag to tether weight and effective lift to tether cross-flow drag. An experiment was performed to verify that two systems of different sizes with matching dimensionless design parameters would have similar dimensionless performance. To demonstrate the kind of design analysis that can be done, altitude is chosen as an example performance goal. Sensitivity studies show that for all the design parameters, there are value regions that are highly sensitive to changes in design parameter and areas that are flat. This means that increasing the effective lift to drag ratio beyond a certain threshold, for example, will give small increases in altitude. While the performance analysis is for generic towed bodies, the stability analysis focuses on rigid wings. Although similar to aircraft, attaching a tether to a flying object increases the amount of information to track and drastically alters modal and stability characteristics. By adapting some airplane analysis techniques to tethered systems the design complexity has been reduced, facilitating intuitive understanding for conceptual design. Static stability criteria is established similar to that of unrestrained aircraft, demonstrating the effect of bridling on static stability. Terms that relate trim and static stability are derived. A simple linear model is also developed for quick evaluation of stability. Stability derivatives from unrestrained aircraft analysis are combined with tether derivatives that give the change in tether force at the attachment point only. The linear model has 12 modes, 6 for the translation degrees of freedom and 6 for the rotational degrees of freedom. A method is presented for determining an optimal performance design. This is done by forming a constrained optimization problem to minimize the cost. The method is demonstrated in the design of a kite to break the single-line kite altitude record. The cost function includes estimates of tether cost and the price of materials for kite construction. Constraints include limits on aerodynamic and structural characteristics along with performance constraints such as required altitude. A stable planform and bridle position are then chosen using the analysis tools developed. Although a full scale design is not built, a sub-scale model, scaled according to the rules derived in the thesis, is flown to demonstrate the feasibility of the design. Using this methodology, parameter studies for environmental inputs and material properties are done for the optimized system.},

	Abstract = {In this work, we study the inconsistency problem of extended Kalman
filter (EKF)-based simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) from
the perspective of observability. We analytically prove that when
the Jacobians of the process and measurement models are evaluated
at the latest state estimates during every time step, the linearized
error-state system employed in the EKF has an observable subspace
of dimension higher than that of the actual, non-linear, SLAM system.
As a result, the covariance estimates of the EKF undergo reduction
in directions of the state space where no information is available,
which is a primary cause of the inconsistency. Based on these theoretical
results, we propose a general framework for improving the consistency
of EKF-based SLAM. In this framework, the EKF linearization points
are selected in a way that ensures that the resulting linearized
system model has an observable subspace of appropriate dimension.
We describe two algorithms that are instances of this paradigm. In
the first, termed observability constrained (OC)-EKF, the linearization
points are selected so as to minimize their expected errors (i.e.
the difference between the linearization point and the true state)
under the observability constraints. In the second, the filter Jacobians
are calculated using the first-ever available estimates for all state
variables. This latter approach is termed first-estimates Jacobian
(FEJ)-EKF. The proposed algorithms have been tested both in simulation
and experimentally, and are shown to significantly outperform the
standard EKF both in terms of accuracy and consistency.},
	Annote = {This is a very interesting paper that shows that for a mobile robot
with range and bearing estimates, the nonlinear observability analysis
shows that there are three unobservable modes (position and orientation).
However, when the system is linearized to be used in the extended
Kalman filter, the linearized system only has two unobservable modes.
In other words, the linear system thinks that it has more information
then it really has.

The authors postulate that the change in observable modes is what
causes the filter to become inconsistent. They also design two modifications
that select different points to linearize the system, and show that
at those points, observability does not change. With the new modifications,
the filter remains consistent.

A very important paper on SLAM.},

used sensor modality for aircraft navigation, researchers
have been motivated to investigate other navigational sensor
modalities because of the desire to operate in GPS denied

A vision-based position and orientation estimation method

method accounts for a limited camera FOV by releasing tracked
features that are about to leave the FOV and tracking new
features. At each time instant that new features are selected for
tracking, the previous pose estimate is updated. The vision-based

guidance system and autopilot. Simulations are performed

A study of the properties of the covariance matrix in this formulation yields analytical upper bounds for the uncertainty of both map representations. Moreover, by employing results from Least Squares estimation theory, the guaranteed accuracy of the robot pose estimates is derived as a function of the accuracy of the robots sensors, and of the properties of the map.

fundamental and novel problems in control theory and robotics.

In particular, in applications such as coverage by mobile sensor

networks or multiple target tracking, a great new challenge is the

development of motion planning algorithms that dynamically assign

targets or destinations to multiple homogeneous agents, not

relying on any a priori assignment of agents to destinations. In

this paper, we address this challenge using two novel ideas. First,

distributed multidestination potential fields are developed that are

able to drive every agent to any available destination. Second, nearest

neighbor coordination protocols are developed ensuring that

distinct agents are assigned to distinct destinations. Integration

of the overall system results in a distributed, multiagent, hybrid

system for which we show that the mutual exclusion property of

the final assignment is guaranteed for almost all initial conditions.

Furthermore, we showthat our dynamic assignment algorithm will

converge after exploring at most a polynomial number of assignments,

dramatically reducing the combinatorial nature of purely

discrete assignment problems. Our scalable approach is illustrated

with nontrivial computer simulations.},

	Annote = {This is an interesting paper that considers the problem of target tracking where the Cartesian position and velocity are being estimated, but the measurements are range and bearing. The paper considers three possible approaches.


1. An EKF where the range and bearing measurements are left in their native polar form.
2. A linear Kalman filter where the range and bearing measurements are first converted to Cartesian coordinates with no additional compensation.
3. A linear linear Kalmand filter where the bias of the conversion process is explicitly taken into account.


It is shown that for large cross track error, i.e., with $\sigma${\_}r*$\sigma${\_}$\theta$is large, that (1) and (2) are inconsistent and lead to poor performance. However (3) remains consistent and gives significantly better performance. The additional overhead of using (3) is minimal, therefore the conclusion is to always use (3).

sound framework that covers joint estimation

of the number of targets and the state of the targets. This paper
describes a particle filter implementation of

the random set multitarget filter. The contribution of this paper
to the random set tracking framework is the

formulation of a measurement model where each sensor report is assumed
to contain at most one measurement.

The implemented filter was tested in synthetic bearings-only tracking
scenarios containing up to two targets in

the presence of false alarms and missed measurements. The estimated
target state consisted of 2D position and

velocity components. The filter was capable to track the targets fairly
well despite of the missing measurements

and the relatively high false alarm rates. In addition, the filter
showed robustness against wrong parameter

values of false alarm rates. The results that were obtained during
the limited tests of the filter show that the

random set framework has potential for challenging tracking situations.
On the other hand, the computational

burden of the described implementation is quite high and increases
approximately linearly with respect to the

expected number of targets.},

One sense and avoid function is self separation, which requires that aircraft remain ``well clear.'' An approach is proposed in this paper to treat well clear as a separation standard, thus posing it as a relative state between aircraft where the risk of collision first reaches an unacceptable level. By this approach, an analytically-derived boundary for well clear can be derived that supports rigorous safety assessment. A preliminary boundary is proposed in both time and distance for the well clear separation standard, and recommendations for future work are made.},

	Annote = {This paper describes an attempt to define the notion of {\&}quot;Well Clear.{\&}quot; The FAA mandates that pilots must maneuver to stay well clear of other aircraft. This is an attempt to make that quantitative for UAS. {\&}quot;Well clear{\&}quot; is defined as {\&}quot;the state of being able to maintain a safe distance from other aircraft so as nto to cause the initiation of a collision avoidance maneuver.{\&}quot;

The recommended boundary is 8000 ft ahead, 3000 ft laterally, and 3000 ft behind the aircraft. This corresponds to a 5{\%} risk contour.

My understanding is that this data old. The newer recommendation corresponds to a 1.5{\%} risk contour.},

Keywords: formation control coordination virtual leaders behavioral
approach artificial potential Lyapunov stability flocking schooling
Comments: This paper analyzes the formation control problem using
a behavioral approach. The behavior of the group is influenced by
the presence of virtual leaders which can be used to shape the final
formations. It is shown how to get triangle, line, and circle formations.
Schooling and flocking behaviors are analyzed. A schooling maneuver
is defined as 'a steady group translation, e.g., where the center
of mass of the group translates.' A flocking maneuver is defined
as 'a motion in which the vehicles circle a stationary point such
that the center of mass of the group is stationary. Lyapunov analysis
is used to guarantee stability of these maneuvers. A nice paper.

	Abstract = {The computationally efficient search for robust feasible paths for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in the presence of uncertainty is a challenging and interesting area of research. In uncertain environments, a ``conservative'' planner may be required but then there may be no feasible solution. In this paper, we use a chance constraint to limit the probability of constraint violation and extend this framework to handle uncertain dynamic obstacles. The approach requires the satisfaction of probabilistic constraints at each time step in order to guarantee probabilistic feasibility. The rapidly-exploring random tree (RRT) algorithm, which enjoys the computational benefits of a sampling-based algorithm, is used to develop a real-time probabilistically robust path planner. It incorporates the chance constraint framework to account for uncertainty within the formulation and includes a number of heuristics to improve the algorithm's performance. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can be used for efficient identification and execution of probabilistically safe paths in real-time.},

features from images that can be used to perform reliable matching
between different views of an object or scene. The features are invariant
to image scale and rotation, and are shown to provide robust matching
across a substantial range of affine distortion, change in 3D viewpoint,
addition of noise, and change in illumination. The features are highly
distinctive, in the sense that a single feature can be correctly
matched with high probability against a large database of features
from many images. This paper also describes an approach to using
these features for object recognition. The recognition proceeds by
matching individual features to a database of features from known
objects using a fast nearest-neighbor algorithm, followed by a Hough
transform to identify clusters belonging to a single object, and
finally performing verification through least-squares solution for
consistent pose parameters. This approach to recognition can robustly
identify objects among clutter and occlusion while achieving near
real-time performance.},

	Abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and proteinâˆ’protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD â‰¤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

control policy, Linear state feedback, Quadratic state feedback,
generalized cost, optimal control Comments: Stabilizing and optimizing
feedback control policies are derived for the important class of
bilinear systems with generalized quadratric cost functions. These
policies as well as the resulting optimal costs are quadratic in
the state. The optimal cost function is shown to be a Lyapunov function
for the bilinear system at hand. The resulting optimal and stabilized
closed-loop system is of third order with respect to the state. One
illustrative example is included.

The basic idea of the paper is to use a `generalized cost function'
to generate a term which cancels our the `nast' nonlinear terms which

been able to fly for about one century. Although the flapping wings
of animals served as an inspiration to pioneers of human flight,
we don't really understand how they work. In this study, we employ
the concept of four-bar linkage to design a flapping mechanism which
simulates a flapping motion of a bird. Wind tunnel tests were performed
to measure the lift and thrust of the mechanical membrane flapping
wing under different frequency, speed, and angle of attack. It is
observed that the flexibility of the wing structure will affect the
thrust and lift force due to its deformation at high flapping frequency.
The lift force will increase with the increase of the flapping frequency
under the corresponding flying speed. For the same flapping frequency,
the flying speed can be increased by decrease of the angle of attack
with the trade of loosing some lift force. An angle of attack is
necessary in a simple flapping motion in order to derive a lift force.
The flapping motion generates the thrust to acquire the flying speed.
The flying speed and angle of attack combine to generate the lift
force for flying.},

By utilizing the motion of the towed body as a differentially flat

Chebyshev polynomials so as to pass through the desired points while

Object tracking, in general, is a challenging problem. Difficulties in tracking objects can arise due to abrupt object motion, changing appearance patterns of both the object and the scene, nonrigid object structures, object-to-object and object-to-scene occlusions, and camera motion. Tracking is usually performed in the context of higher-level applications that require the location and/or shape of the object in every frame. Typically, assumptions are made to constrain the tracking problem in the context of a particular application. In this survey, we categorize the tracking methods on the basis of the object and motion representations used, provide detailed descriptions of representative methods in each category, and examine their pros and cons. Moreover, we discuss the important issues related to tracking including the use of appropriate image features, selection of motion models, and detection of objects.},

	Abstract = { Location: shelf Keywords: Linear, Orthonormal basis, transfer functions,
system identification Comments: In many areas of signal, system,
and control theory, orthogonal functions play an important role in
issues of analysis and design. In this paper it is shown that there
exist orthogonal functions that, in a natural way, are generated
by stable linear dynamical systems and that compose an orthonormal
basis for the signal space l{\^{}}n{\_}2. To this end, use is made of balanced
realizations of inner tranfer functions. The orthogonal functions
can be considered as generalizations of, e.g., the pulse functions,
Laguerre functions, and Kautz functions, and give rise to an alternative
series expansion of rational transfer functions. It is shown how
we can exploit these generalized basis functions to increase the
speed of convergence in a series expansion, i.e., to obtain a good
approximation by retaining only a finite number of expansion coefficients.
Consequences for identification of expansion coefficients are analyzed,
and a bound is formulated on the error that is made when approximating
a system by a finite number of expansion coefficents. },

The problem of an invariant continuous-time model with discrete-time measurements is cast into a rigorous stochastic and geometric framework. Building upon the theory of continuous-time invariant observers, we show that, as in the linear case, the error equation is a Markov chain that does not depend on the state estimate. Thus, when the filter's gains are held fixed, and the filter admits almost-global convergence properties with noise turned off, the noisy error's distribution is proved to converge to a stationary distribution, providing insight into the mathematical theory of filtering on Lie groups. For engineering purposes we also introduce the discrete-time Invariant Extended Kalman Filter, for which the trusted covariance matrix is shown to asymptotically converge, and some numerically more involved sample-based methods as well to compute the Kalman gains. The methods are applied to attitude estimation, allowing to derive novel theoretical results in this field, and illustrated through simulations on synthetic data.},

	Abstract = {Flying ?xed-wing miniature air vehicles (FW-MAVs) in urban terrain
is a challenging

task because of unstructured urban environments, the minimum speed
requirement for

?ight of ?xed-wing vehicles, and the non-holonomic characteristics
of FW-MAVs. While

traditional path-planning algorithms can e?ectively overcome many
of these constraints,

if the FW-MAV detects new obstacles in-?ight that were not included
in the initial path-

planning, immediate action must be taken to avoid collision. Re-planning
with traditional

path-planning algorithms is not feasible due to the time required
to plan an entire path.

Therefore, a reactive collision avoidance system must be used to guarantee
obstacle avoid-

ance until a new path can be planned which includes the newly sensed
information.

In this paper we develop a reactive nonlinear collision avoidance
guidance law for FW-

MAVs ?ying in urban terrain. Our guidance law is designed for the
scenario where a wall

or other large object is observed. In this case, we would like the
FW-MAV to maintain a

speci?ed safe distance away from the obstacle over time. The algorithm
is developed using

Lyapunov stability theory, relative geometry between the FW-MAV and
the obstacle, and

sliding-mode theory. The FW-MAV reacts given the range information
between the FW-

MAV and the obstacle at a constant bearing. We show that our guidance
law guarantees

the convergence of distance between the FW-MAV and the obstacle to
the desired safe

distance. Simulation results show that the guidance law is successful
in navigating the

FW-MAV between zigzag walls, non parallel walls, curved walls, and
avoids sharp corners

trajectory-tracking control law for unmanned aerial vehicles
where an unmodifiable autopilot is incorporated in the closedloop
system. The main contributions of this paper include
a novel control structure that enables an explicit design of
tracking methods for a system with an unmodifiable autopilot
in the loop, and a novel controller that augments the existing
control law. To begin with, a controller is developed based on a
generalized design model using a Lyapunov-based backstepping
technique. To incorporate the constraints due to the unmodifiable
autopilot, the design model and the developed controller
are augmented by introducing additional terms. Lyapunov stability
theory is used to prove that, without any modification of
the autopilot, the augmented controller exponentially stabilizes
the vehicle to a desired trajectory while the other higher
order and attitude states remain bounded. A software-in-theloop
simulation result is presented to validate the strategy.
The proposed strategy can be employed to ensure the vehicle
remains safe while experimenting with new tracking and path
following control options. This type of control design are most
useful for systems where the autopilot is unmodifiable, and
possibly unknown, as would occur with commercial autopilots
being augmented with high level tracking control.},

	Abstract = {This paper develops a hybrid control strategy that provides autonomous transition between hovered and leveled flights to a model-scale fixed-wing aircraft. The aircraft's closed-loop dynamics are described by means of a hybrid automaton with the hover, transition, level, and recovery operating modes, each one corresponding to a different region of the flight envelope. Linear parameter varying control techniques are employed in hover and level, providing robust local stabilization, and a nonlinear locally input-to-state stable controller provides practical reference tracking to the transition operating mode. These controllers, together with an appropriate choice of reference maneuvers, ensure that a transition from hovered flight to level flight, or vice versa, is achieved. Whenever the aircraft state reaches unexpected values, the recovery controller is triggered in order to drive the aircraft toward stable hovered flight, providing a chance to retry the transition maneuver. The controllers' performance and robustness is assessed within a realistic simulation environment in the presence of sensor noise.},

	Abstract = {A bifilar (two-wire) pendulum is a torsional pendulum consisting of
a test object

suspended by two thin parallel wires. The pendulum oscillates about
the vertical axis. The

restoring torque of the bifilar pendulum is provided by the gravitational
force as rotations

from the rest state cause the test object to raise slightly. The
mass moment of inertia is

computed using dynamic modeling, measurements of the oscillation
period, and the physical

dimensions of the bifilar pendulum such as the length and separation
displacement of the

pendulum wires. A simulation technique is described that improves
estimates of the mass

moment of inertia by considering the nonlinear effects of damping
and large angular

displacements. An analysis of the error variance of mass moment of
inertia measurements is

also described. The resulting expression for the error variance is
used to optimize the physical

parameters of the bifilar pendulum to obtain the moment of inertia
measurement with the

minimum error variance. Monte Carlo simulations were used to validate
the parameter

optimization technique. Experimental results are presented for a
uniform-density test object

for which the moment of inertia is straightforward to compute from
geometric considerations.

Results are also presented for a small unmanned air vehicle, which
was the intended

application for this moment of inertia measurement technique.},

of boundary layer energization by means of a small flapping foil
embedded in a flat-plate boundary layer, the reduction of the recirculatory
flow region behind a backward-facing step by means of a small flapping
foil, and the reduction or suppression of flow separation behind
blunt or cusped airfoil trailing edges by flapping a small foil located
in the wake flow region. These studies were followed by systematic
investigations of the aerodynamic characteristics of single flapping
airfoils and airfoil combinations. These unsteady flows were described
using flow visualization, laser-Doppler velocimetry in addition to
panel and Navier--Stokes computations. It is then shown how this
flapping-wing database was used to conceive, design and develop a
micro air vehicle which has a fixed wing for lift and two flapping
wings for thrust generation. While animal flight is characterized
by a coupled force generation, the present design appears to separate
lift and thrust. However, in fact, the performance of one surface

control systems, an organized method of testing new control systems,
virtual cameras for vision-based control, and methods of testing
new control in the transition from simulation to flight tests. In
an environment where researchers are temporary, such as a university,
a standard research and development platform with these properties
expedites prototyping and prevents code loss when an employee leaves.We
develop a research simulation which conforms to all of these properties
inside a Matlab environment. A series of mex functions provide connections
to the autopilot for hardware-in-theloop testing, graphical interfaces,
and vision processing. The option to write C mex functions offers
a seamless method of porting code to embedded systems, minimizing
coding errors. We demonstrate fast prototyping by showing flight
test data where the simulation provided virtual vision data to avoid
virtual obstacles.},

@article{CanaleFagianoMilanese10,
	Abstract = {Abstract---This paper presents simulation and experimental results

regarding a new class of wind energy generators, denoted as

KiteGen, which employ power kites to capture high altitude wind

power. A realistic kite model, which includes the kite aerodynamic

characteristics and the effects of line weight and drag forces, is

used to describe the system dynamics. Nonlinear model predictive

control techniques, together with an efficient implementation

based on set membership function approximation theory, are employed

to maximize the energy obtained by KiteGen, while satisfying

input and state constraints. Two different kinds of KiteGen

are investigated through numerical simulations, the yo-yo configuration

and the carousel configuration, respectively. For each configuration,

a generator with the same kite and nominal wind characteristics

is considered. A novel control strategy for the carousel

configuration, with respect to previous works, is also introduced.

The simulation results show that the power generation potentials

of the yo-yo and carousel configurations are very similar. Thus,

the choice between these two configurations for further development

of a medium-to-large scale generator will be made on the

basis of technical implementation problems and of other indexes

like construction costs and generated power density with respect to

land occupation. Experimental data, collected using the small-scale

KiteGen prototype built at Politecnico di Torino, are compared

to simulation results. The good matching between simulation and

real measured data increases the confidence with the presented

simulation results, which show that energy generation with controlled

power kites can represent a quantum leap in wind power

technology, promising to obtain renewable energy from a source

largely available almost everywhere, with production costs lower

than those of fossil sources.},

	Abstract = {Abstract---In this paper, we present the design of the flight control
algorithms for flapping wing micromechanical flying insects (MFIs).
Inspired by the sensory feedback and neuromotor structure of insects,
we propose a similar top-down hierarchical architecture to achieve
high performance despite the MFIs' limited on-board computational
resources. The flight stabilization problem is formulated as high-frequency
periodic control of an underactuated system. In particular, we provide
a methodology to approximate the time-varying dynamics caused by
the aerodynamic forces with a time-invariant model using averaging
theory and a biomimetic parametrization of the wing trajectories.
This approximation leads to a simpler dynamical model that can be
identified using experimental data from the on-board sensors and
the voltage inputs to the wing actuators. The overall control law
is a periodic proportional output feedback. Simulations, including
sensor and actuator models, demonstrate stable flight in hovering
mode.},

@article{AgrawalXu94,
	Abstract = { Location: Shelf Keywords: Robot Manipulator, Path Planning, Space,
Holonomic and Nonholonomic Constraints, Variational approach, free
flying, kinematic redundancy. Comments: Robotic manipulators will
play a significant role in the maintenance and repair of space stations
and satellites, and other future space missions. Robot path planning
and control for the above applications should be optimum, since any
inefficiency in the planning may considerably risk the success of
the space mission. This paper presents a global optimum path planning
scheme for redundant space robotic manipulators to be used in such
missions. In this formulation, a variational approach is used to
minimize the objective functional. It is assumed that the gravity
is zero in space, and the robotic manipulator is mounted on a completely
free-flying base and the attitude control is off. Linear and angular
monentum conditions for this system lead to a set of mixed holonomic
and nonholonomic constraints. These equations are adjoined to the
objective functional using a Lagrange multiplier technique. The formulation
leads to a system of Differential and Algebraic Equations. A numerical
scheme for forward integration of this system is presented. A planar
redundant space manipulator consisting of three arms and a base is
considered to demonstrate the feasibility of the formulation. The
approach to optimum path planning of redundant space robots is significant
since most robots that have been developed for space applications
so far are redundant. The kinematic redundancy of space robots offers
efficient control and provides the necessary dexterity for extra-vehicular
activity that exheeds human capacity. },

Although dynamic programing has long provided a powerful approach
to optimization problems, its applicability has been somewhat limited
because of the large computational requirements of the standard computational
algorithm. In recent years a number of new procedures with greatly
reduced computational requirements have been developed. The purpose
of this paper is to survey a number of the more promising of those
techniques. A review of the theory of dynamic programming and the
standard computational algorithm is included. Several applications
of the new techniques are discussed. },

for the analysis of the attitude tracking control problem for a rigid

feedback linearizes the attitude dynamics to a double integrator
form with respect to some minimal representation of the orientation,
a large family of globally stable control laws are obtained by using
the globally nonsingular unit quaternion representation in a Lyapunov
function candidate whose form is motivated by the consideration of
total energy of the rigid body. The controllers share the common
structure of a proportional-derivative feedback plus some feedforward
which can be zero (the model-independent case), the Coriolis torque
compensation, or an adaptive compensation. These controller structures
are compared in terms of the requirement on the a priori model information,
guaranteed transient performance, and robustness. The global stability
of the Luh-Walker-Paul robot end-effector controller is also analyed

that the minimizer of this convex optimization problem

	Abstract = {This article presents a robust and almost global feedback attitude
tracking control scheme in conjunction with a robust deterministic
estimator that constructs state esti- mates for feedback. These control
and the estimation schemes use the natural and globally unique representation
of rigid body attitude provided by rotation matrices. Attitude and
angular velocity state estimates are constructed from discrete (possibly
multi-rate) mea- surements and a deterministic filtering scheme.
Computational implementation of this estimator-based tracking scheme
is carried out with a Lie group variational integrator, which preserves
the rotation matrix structure without need for reprojection. Numerical
simulation results obtained using this integrator show the robust
and almost global track- ing properties of this scheme. We also compare
the performance of this attitude tracking control scheme with a quaternion
observer-based feedback attitude tracking control scheme that has
appeared in recent literature. Numerical simulation results are obtained
for track- ing an oscillating angular velocity spin maneuver with
both the attitude tracking schemes for a satellite in circular Earth
orbit. These results demonstrate the advantages of our scheme in
attitude tracking of continuous rotational motions.},

	Abstract = {This paper derives a 3D missile guidance strategy that minimizes the
total maneuver energy. The solution is derived using Pontryagin's
minimum principle. An interesting result is that the optimal guidance
law maintains the trajectory of the interceptor in a single plane
of motion. Therefore, the 2D result is used, and then lifted into
3D. The results is compared to pure proportional navigation and shown
to be much better. However, I do not think that the comparison is
fair. First, the OGL is an open loop strategy whereas PPNG is a feedback
strategy. Second, since we assume that the motion of the target is
known to the interceptor, it would be more appropriate to compare
OGL to augmented proportional navigation which uses this information
and also guarantees that the acceleration goes to zero at intercept.

The equations for 3D pronav are succinctly stated and are particularly
clear.},

	Abstract = {Collision avoidance systems play an important role in the future of aviation safety. Before new technologies on board manned or unmanned aircraft are deployed, rigorous analysis using encounter simulations is required to prove system robustness. These simulations rely on models that accurately reflect the geometries and dynamics of aircraft encounters at close range. These types of encounter models have been developed by several organizations since the early 1980s. Lincoln Laboratory's newer encounter models, however, provide a higher-fidelity representation of encounters, are based on substantially more data, leverage a theoretical framework for finding optimal model structures, and reflect recent changes in the airspace. Three categories of encounter model were developed by Lincoln Laboratory. Two of these categories are used for modeling conventional aircraft; one involving encounters with prior air traffic control intervention and one without. The third category of encounter model is for encounters with unconventional aircraft---such as gliders, skydivers, balloons, and airships---that typically do not carry transponders. Together, these encounter models are being used to examine the safety and effectiveness of aircraft collision avoidance systems and as a foundation for algorithms for future manned and unmanned systems.},

	Abstract = {In this paper, we develop a method to impart the chaotic nature to
a mobile robot. The chaotic mobile robot implies a mobile robot with a
controller that ensures chaotic motions. Chaotic motion is characterized
by the topological transitivity and the sensitive dependence on initial
conditions. Due to the topological transitivity, the chaotic mobile
robot is guaranteed to scan the whole connected workspace. For scanning
motion, the chaotic robot neither requires the map of the workspace nor
plans the global motion. It only requires the measurement of the local
normal of the workspace boundary when it comes close to it. We design
the controller such that the total dynamics of the mobile robot is
represented by the Arnold equation, which is known to show the chaotic
behavior of noncompressive perfect fluid. Experimental results and their
analysis illustrate the usefulness of the proposed controller},

extended Kalman filter spacecraft Comments: This paper details the
use of the Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) as it applies to spacecraft
attitude estimation. The application of the UKF is clearly explained.
Quaternions are used to represent the attitude of the spacecraft.
The paper explains that straightforward application of the UKF results
in measurement update equations that violate the unit norm constraint
of the unit quaternion. As an alternative the attitude error is converted
to an attitude representation that looks like a modified Rodrigues
parameterization. The measurement update is performed with these
parameters and then converted back into quaternion representation
for the time update law. Simulation results indicate that for large
initial attitude error, the UKF performs significantly better than
the EKF. },

function candidate suitable for the synthesis of guidance laws, which
are free of singularities, and for the analysis of missile-target
system stability taking into account the whole state, namely LOS
angle, LOS rate, and relative missile-target range. The paper proposed
nonlinear guidance laws for two classes of target maneuvers: 1) no
maneuver and 2) maneuvering target with delayed estimates of target
acceleration available to the guidance law. It was shown that uniform
ultimate boundedness of the missile-target system state is obtained
in the case of highly maneuvering targets. For a nonmaneuvering target,
asymptotic stability was demonstrated. Numerical simulations showed
that the nonlinear guidance laws proposed in this paper result in
improved performance when compared with PNG. In this paper, the flight
control system dynamics were assumed to be ideal. However, it is
known that system lags result in miss distances, and therefore the
work presented in this paper is currently being extended to the synthesis
of a more sophisticated nonlinear guidance law that takes into account
uncertain missile dynamics. },

A factor graph formulation is introduced that allows multi-rate, asyn- chronous, and possibly delayed measurements to be incorporated in a natural way. This method, based on a recently developed incremental smoother, automatically determines the number of states to recompute at each step, effectively acting as an adaptive fixed-lag smoother. This yields an efficient and general framework for information fusion, providing nearly-optimal state estimates. In particular, incoming IMU measurements can be processed in real time regardless to the size of the graph. The proposed method is demonstrated in a simulated environment using IMU, GPS and stereo vision measurements and compared to the optimal solution obtained by a full non-linear batch optimization and to a conventional extended Kalman filter (EKF).},

perform mobile robot localization by matching terrain maps. The method
is based upon a maximum-likelihood robot localization algorithm that
efficiently searches the space of possible robot positions. We use a
sensor error model to estimate the probability distribution of the

estimated distribution is compared to a previously generated map of the
terrain and the optimal landmark is selected by minimizing the predicted
uncertainty in the localization. This approach can be used to generate a
sensor uncertainty field for use by the robot's planning component.

Theory, George Saridis, Upper bounds, Comments: In this thesis, a
design method is proposed to iteratively improve the performance
of a given suboptimal, admissible feedback control law for a deterministic
nonlinear system. In the case of the nonlinear regulator problem,
the method is shown to lead to successively improved, asymptotically
stable control laws. These control laws are also robust with respect
to parameter variations in the system equation and variations in
the control actuator gains. Moreover, unlike the methods proposed
in the past, the design method requires only the determination of
upper bounds to the performance of a given control law and not the
actual value function itself. This provides a degree of flexibility,
leading to a solution method for finding the upper bound functions
as a Lipschitz continuous tensor product spline function obtained
by solving a linear programming problem. The design method is demonstrated
by developing successively improved controllers for mechanical manipulator
arm. },

	Abstract = {There are many algorithms developed for tracking and detecting faint moving objects in congested backgrounds. One obvious application is detection of targets in images where each pixel corresponds to the received power in a particular location. In our application, a visible imager operated in stare mode observes geostationary objects as fixed, stars as moving and non-geostationary objects as drifting in the field of view. We would like to achieve high sensitivity detection of the drifters. The ability to improve SNR with ``track-before-detect (TBD)'' processing, where target information is collected and collated before the detection decision is made, allows respectable performance against dim moving objects. Generally, a TBD algorithm consists of a pre-processing stage that highlights potential targets and a temporal filtering stage. However, the algorithms that have been successfully demonstrated, e.g. Viterbi-based and Bayesian-based, demand formidable processing power and memory. We propose an algorithm that exploits the quasi constant velocity of objects, the predictability of the stellar clutter and the intrinsically low false alarm rate of detecting signature candidates in 3-D, based on an iterative method called "RANdom SAmple Consensus'' and one that can run real-time on a typical PC. The technique is tailored for searching objects with small telescopes in stare mode. Our RANSAC-MT (Moving Target) algorithm estimates parameters of a mathematical model (e.g., linear motion) from a set of observed data which contains a significant number of outliers while identifying inliers. In the pre-processing phase, candidate blobs were selected based on morphology and an intensity threshold that would normally generate unacceptable level of false alarms. The RANSAC sampling rejects candidates that conform to the predictable motion of the stars. Data collected with a 17 inch telescope by AFRL/RH and a COTS lens/EM-CCD sensor by the AFRL/RD Satellite Assessment Center is used to assess the performance of the algorithm. In the second application, a visible imager operated in sidereal mode observes geostationary objects as moving, stars as fixed except for field rotation, and non-geostationary objects as drifting. RANSAC-MT is used to detect the drifter. In this set of data, the drifting space object was detected at a distance of 13800 km. The AFRL/RH set of data, collected in the stare mode, contained the signature of two geostationary satellites. The signature of a moving object was simulated and added to the sequence of frames to determine the sensitivity in magnitude. The performance compares well with the more intensive TBD algorithms reported in the literature.},

	Annote = {This paper describes the RANSAC-MT algorithm where MT stands for Moving Target. The idea is to detect a low SNR moving object in significant background clutter. In that sense the RANSAC-MT algorithm has similar objectives to the R-RANSAC algorithm. However, R-RANSAC is different in a couple of significant ways. First, it does not operate on batch data, but rather on sequential data received in real-time. Second, R-RANSAC can incorporate any motion model and not just linear data since it essentially establishesa bank of Kalman filters for each potential model.},

(UAV) mission eectiveness by extracting energy from the atmosphere.
Specically, we consider an aerial surveillance mission in the vicinity
of a geographic ridge. Cross winds owing over the ridge produce regions
of lift on the windward side that can be exploited to increase mission
duration. Mission eectiveness is quantied using the seeability
metric. Simulation results are presented for several observation
target placements. Results indicate that seeability and imaging persistence
can be improved by exploiting ridge lift. Simulations demonstrated
that targets at ranges less than four times the ridge height were
able to be observed over an indenite period by a UAV with a glide
ratio of 11:1.},

vehicle navigation requires data structures capable of representing

indoor and outdoor 3D environments. The vehicle must

be able to update the map structure in real time using readings

from range-finding sensors when mapping unknown areas; it

must also be able to look up occupancy information from

the map for the purposes of localization and path-planning.

Mapping models that have been used for these tasks include

voxel grids, multi-level surface maps, and octrees. In this paper,

we suggest a new approach to 3D mapping using a multi-volume

occupancy grid, or MVOG. MVOGs explicitly store information

about both obstacles and free space. This allows us to correct

previous potentially erroneous sensor readings by incrementally

fusing in new positive or negative sensor information. In turn,

this enables extracting more reliable probabilistic information

about the occupancy of 3D space. MVOGs outperform existing

probabilistic 3D mapping methods in terms of memory usage,

due to the fact that observations are grouped together into

continuous vertical volumes to save space. We describe the

techniques required for mapping using MVOGs, and analyze

their performance using indoor and outdoor experimental data.},

these algorithms are able to generate admissible

planning algorithm is also augmented with a

potential field-based trajectory replanner,

which solves for a detouring trajectory around

other agents or pop-up obstacles. For validation,

test scenarios for multiple UAVs to perform

cooperative missions in dynamic environments

are considered. The proposed algorithms are

implemented on a fixed-wing UAVs testbed in

development of autonomous flying vehicles.Whereas most of the

proposed approaches are suitable for outdoor operation, only

a few techniques have been designed for indoor environments.

In this paper we present a general system consisting of sensors

and algorithms which enables a small sized flying vehicle to

operate indoors. This is done by adapting techniques which

have been successfully applied on ground robots. We released

our system as open-source with the intention to provide the

community with a new framework for building applications

for indoor flying robots. We present a set of experiments to

validate our system on an open source quadrotor.},

The redundant sensor configuration also allows for fault detection,

which is required for many autonomous applications. This initiative

is a precursor for future developments with more sensors to provide

fault isolation. The paper will also present a navigation system implementing

the redundant IMU with the global positioning system.

that of a prescribed, driven, nonlinear model. A set of necessary
conditions for achieving asymptotic model matching is established.
One of these involves the stability properties for a subdynamics
which is common to every model matching closed loop. This subdynamics,
called the fixed dynamics, is intrinsically characterized. Based
on these results, a new set of sufficient conditions for achieving
asymptotoic model matching is given. The interrelation between the
minimum phase and vector relative degree properties of a plant and
a matchable model are studied. },

	Abstract = {A quaternion-based attitude control system is developed for the
X-33 in the ascent flight phase. A nonlinear control law commands
body-axis rotation rates that align the angular velocity vector with an
Euler-axis defining the axis of rotation that takes the body-axis system
into a desired-axis system. The magnitudes of the commanded body rates
are determined by the magnitude of the rotation error The commanded body
rates form the input to a dynamic inversion-based
adaptive/reconfigurable control law. The indirect adaptive control
portion uses online system identification to estimate the current
control effectiveness matrix to update a control allocation module. The
control allocation nominally operates in a minimum deflection mode;
however, if a fault is detected, it can operate in a null-space
injection mode that excites and decorrelates the effecters without
degrading the vehicle response in order to enable online system
identification. The overall system is designed to provide fault and
damage tolerance for the X-33 on ascent. The baseline control law
supports full envelope operation and eliminates trajectory dependent
gain-scheduling that is typically found on this type of vehicle.
Preliminary results are shown to demonstrate the feasibility of the
approach},

	Abstract = {Abstract. Monte-Carlo evaluation consists in estimating a position by
averaging the outcome of several random continuations, and can serve
as an evaluation function at the leaves of a min-max tree. This paper
presents a new framework to combine tree search with Monte-Carlo evaluation,
that does not separate between a min-max phase and a MonteCarlo
phase. Instead of backing-up the min-max value close to the root,
and the average value at some depth, a more general backup operator
is defined that progressively changes from averaging to min-max as the
number of simulations grows. This approach provides a fine-grained control
of the tree growth, at the level of individual simulations, and allows
efficient selectivity methods. This algorithm was implemented in a 9 Ã— 9
Go-playing program, Crazy Stone, that won the 10th KGS computer-Go

	Abstract = {This paper presents a vision-based collision avoidance technique for Miniature Air Vehicles (MAVs) using local-level frame mapping and planning in spherical coordinates. To explicitly address the obstacle initialization problem, the maps are parameterized using the inverse time-to-collision (TTC), which is independent of the ground speed of the MAV. Using bearing-only measurements, an extended Kalman Filter (EKF) is employed to estimate the inverse TTC, azimuth, and elevation to obstacles. A nonlinear observability analysis is used to derive conditions for the observability of the system. Based on these conditions, we design a path planning algorithm that minimizes the estimation uncertainties while simultaneously avoiding collisions with obstacles. The behavior of the planning algorithm is analyzed and the characteristics of the environment in which the planning algorithm guarantees collision-free paths for MAVs are described. Numerical results show that the proposed method is successful in solving the path planning problem for MAVs.},

The model finds application in a variety of fields including synchronization, swarming and distributed decision making. In the model, each agent updates his current state based upon the current information received from neighboring agents. Necessary and/or sufficient conditions for the convergence of the individual agents' states to a common value are presented, thereby extending recent results reported in the literature. The stability analysis is based upon a blend of graph-theoretic and system-theoretic tools with the notion of convexity playing a central role. The analysis is integrated within a formal framework of set-valued Lyapunov theory, which may be of independent interest. Among others, it is observed that more communication does not necessarily lead to faster convergence and may eventually even lead to a loss of convergence, even for the simple models discussed in the present paper.},

	Abstract = {In target tracking systems measurements are typically collected in
"scans" or "frames" and then they are transmitted to a processing
center. In multisensor tracking systems that operate in a centralized
manner, there are usually different time delays in transmitting the
scans or frames from the various sensors to the center. This can
lead to situations where measurements from the same target arrive
out of sequence. Such "out-of-sequence" measurement (OOSM) arrivals
can occur even in the absence of scan/frame communication time delays.
The resulting "negative-time measurement update" problem, which is
quite common in real multisensor systems, was solved previously only
approximately in the literature. The exact state update equation
for such a problem is presented. The optimal and two suboptimal algorithms
are compared on a number of realistic examples, including a GMTI
(ground moving target indicator) radar case.},

	Abstract = {This article presents a real time Unmanned Aerial Vehicles UAVs 3D pose estimation method using planar object tracking, in order to be used on the control system of a UAV. The method explodes the rich information obtained by a projective transformation of planar objects on a calibrated camera. The algorithm obtains the metric and projective components of a reference object (landmark or helipad) with respect to the UAV camera coordinate system, using a robust real time object tracking based on homographies. The algorithm is validated on real flights that compare the estimated data against that obtained by the inertial measurement unit IMU, showing that the proposed method robustly estimates the helicopter's 3D position with respect to a reference landmark, with a high quality on the position and orientation estimation when the aircraft is flying at low altitudes, a situation in which the GPS information is often inaccurate. The obtained results indicate that the proposed algorithm is suitable for complex control tasks, such as autonomous landing, accurate low altitude positioning and dropping of payloads.},

In my oppinion, this is a very substantial paper. The basic idea
is to cascade an Euler-Lagrange system (control) with the plant,
also modelled as an EL system, to obtain a larger EL system. EL systems
are passive systems, and so if you make the controller dissipative,
the closed loop system will be globally asymptotically stable. There
are many advantages, including the fact that only output feedback
is required. Also, there are extensions to input saturation constraints.

describes a computational technique for generating trajectories for
differentially flat systems in near real-time. Step 1. The state
equations are embedded in the flat space. Step 2. The state and input
constraints are converted to the flat space. Step 3. Semi-infinite
optimization is used to approximate the possibly nonlinear and nonconvex
constraints using polytopes. Step 4. The trajectory is parameterized
using basis functions. Step 5. A collocation method is used to convert
the trajectory into a set of points that must lie within the polytope
generated in Step 3. Step 6. An optimization step finds the trajectory
coefficients to satisfy the constraints. Step 3 is performed off-line,
while step 6 is performed on-line.},

stabilizing feedback controller that minimized the $\backslash$calL{\_}1 norm
of a closed-loop transfer matrix subject to a frequency domain $\backslash$Hinf

that for a one-block problem the optimal solution can be approximated

by solving a sequence of convex optimization problems over linear
matrix inequalities. Numerical example is provided to demonstrate
the effectiveness of this approach. },

effects, such as lightning, severe storms and equipment failures,

important parameters, such as effective reactances of tranmission
lines, in an electric power system always contain some uncertaintaies.
The aim of this paper is to discuss transient stability enhancement

techniques and an adaptive control approach. A nonlinear controller
design approach is employed to design an adaptive nonlinear control
law to prevent the loss of synchronism is a power system under a
large sudden fault. An adaptive nonlinear controller is proposed
and the stability results for the overall system are established.
Simulation results show that transient stability enhancement and

Although the exact computation of association probabili- ties in JPDA is NP-hard, we prove that the single-scan MCMCDA algorithm provides a fully polynomial randomized approximation scheme for JPDA. For general multi-target tracking problems, in which unknown numbers of targets appear and disappear at random times, we present a multi-scan MCMCDA algorithm that approximates the optimal Bayesian filter. We also present extensive simulation studies supporting theoretical results in this paper. Our simulation results also show that MCMCDA outperforms multiple hypothesis tracking (MHT) by a significant margin in terms of accuracy and efficiency under extreme conditions, such as a large number of targets in a dense environment, low detection probabilities, and high false alarm rates.},

a C{\^{}}1 function V>0 such that $\backslash$inf{\_}u$\backslash$in U V{\_}x$\backslash$cdot f(x,u) < 0

V also satisifies the small control property (not called this in
the paper). The author claims that the difference between this paper
and $\backslash$cite{Sontag83} is Sontag does not look for Smooth clf's. Indeed
this paper guarantees the existence of smooth clf given that a smooth
relaxed control can asymptotically stabilize the system. $\backslash$cite{Sontag83}

is taken. These algorithms are applied in simulation scenarios for

Multiple Spacecraft, Follow-the-leader Comments: The problem of coordination
and control of multiple microspacecraft moving in formation is considered.
Here, each MS is modelled by a rigid body with fixed center of mass.
First, various schemes for generating the desired formation patterns
are discussed. The explicit control laws for formation keeping and
relative attidue alignment based on nearest neighbor-tracking are
derived. The necessary data which must be communicated between the
MS to achieve effective control are examined. The time-domain behavior
of the feedback-controlled MS formation for typical low-Earth orbits
is studied both analyticallly and via computer simulation. The paper
concludes with a discussion of the implementation of the derived
control laws, and the integration of the MS formation coordination
and control system with a proposed inter-spacecraft communication/computing
network.

This paper derives control laws for micro-satellites flying in tightly
controlled formations. Position and attitude control laws are derived
to maintain relative position and attitude control laws. The controls
are based on tracking each spacecraft nearest neighbor. },

The problem is to estimate the skews and offsets of clocks of all the nodes with respect to an arbitrary reference clock. Pairs of nodes that can communicate with each other can obtain noisy measurements of the relative skews and offsets between them. We propose a distributed algorithm with which each node can estimate its offset/skew from these noisy relative measurements by communicating only with its neighbors. The algorithm is simple and easy to implement. We model the change in the communication network due to the moving nodes as a Markov chain whose state space is the set of graphs that can occur. Using tools from Markov Jump Linear Systems, we provide a sufficient condition for the mean square convergence of the estimation error. A conjecture on mean square convergence under weaker conditions is discussed. Monte Carlo simulations are provided that corroborate the predictions and justify the conjecture.},

biases, non-unit scale factors, axis misalignments and cross-axis
sensitivities of both the tri-axial accelerometer and gyroscopic

of gyroscopes is significantly improved by comparing the outputs

allow the gyroscopes to be calibrated without external equipment,
such as a turntable, or requirint precise maneuvers. Both factors
allow the IMU to be easily calibrated by a user in the field so that
it can function as an accurate orientation sensor. A custom-made
prototype IMU is used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed
methods, with data that are carefully obtained using prescribed motions,
as well as those less rigorously colleced from the IMU when it is
mounted on the head of a user or held in hands with brief random

We have developed a novel cost function that can be used to optimally traverse a path that covers a region. The {UGV} model and cost function are developed theoretically and verified experimentally. Our cost function weights force inputs, area covered and motor efficiency to create an optimal trajectory. This trajectory is constrained to follow a coverage path described in the literature. The path is modified based on the cost function by replacing turn-in-place maneuvers by moving turns. Tradeoffs are presented for three cases: (1) drive motor efficiency is not considered, (2) the motors are most efficient at the maximum velocity, and (3) the motors are most efficient below the maximum velocity. Optimality tradeoffs include the time required to cover the region, and the energy required to complete the trajectory. Experimental results using an {iRobot} Packbot are presented.},

	Abstract = {Identification concerning different types of radar targets can be achieved by using various radar signatures, such as one-dimensional (1-D) range profiles, 2-D radar images, and 1-D or 2-D scattering centres on a target. To solve the target identification problem, the authors utilise 1-D scattering centres, which correspond to the highest peaks in the 1-D range profile. The proposed approach obtains scale and translational-invariant features based on the central moments from the distribution of the 1-D scattering centres on the target; these 1-D scattering centres can be extracted from various techniques such as inverse fast Fourier transform (IFFT), fast root-multiple signal classification (fast root-MUSIC), total least squares-Prony (TLS-Prony), generalised eigenvalues utilising signal subspace eigenvectors (GEESE), and the matrix-pencil (MP) algorithm. The information redundancy contained in these features, as well as their dimensions, are further reduced via the Karhunen--Loeve transform, followed by adequate scaling of the computed central moments. The resulting small dimensional and redundancy-free feature vectors are classified using the Bayes classifier. Finally, this new strategy for radar-target identification is demonstrated with data measured in the compact range facility, and the above five different techniques for 1-D scattering centre extraction are compared and investigated in the context of target identification},

of a PD2 feedback structure, where the proportional action is
in terms of the vector quaternion and the two derivative actions
are in terms of the airframe angular velocity and the vector
quaternion velocity. We also show that the model-independent
PD controller, where the proportional action is in terms of the
vector-quaternion and the derivative action is in terms of the airframe
angular velocity, without compensation of the Coriolis and
gyroscopic torques, provides asymptotic stability for our problem.
The proposed controller as well as some other controllers have
been tested experimentally on a small-scale quadrotor aircraft.},
	Annote = {This is an excellent paper describing the dynamics of a quadrotor and two attitude stabilization schemes.  The first is a PD^2 controller that compensates for Coriolis and gyroscopic coupling between the rotors and vehicle.  They show exponential stability with the PD^2 controller.  The second is a simple PD controller that does not require any physical parameters.  Only asymptotic stability can be shown, but the results is simple and intuitive.  The controller uses quaternion feedback.

The proposed attitude estimation scheme is with a complementary filter, but there are issues since the experimental results are using a platform on a stick.

I should use this paper as the basis for modeling for the quadrotorbook.

Often, to fully prosecute a target, a variety of assets may be required, and it may be necessary to deliver these assets simultaneously. Therefore, a team of UAVs that satisfies the target resource requirement needs to be assigned to a single target, and this team is called a coalition. Other desired requirements for the coalition are (i) minimize the target prosecution delay and (ii) minimize the size of the coalition. In this paper, we propose a two-stage optimal coalition formation algorithm that assigns appropriate numbers of UAVs satisfying the desired requirements. We developed a Dubins curves based simultaneous strike scheme. Simulation results are presented to show that the two-stage coalition formation algorithm has low computational overhead and can be applied in real-time.},

robust w.r.t. additive disturbance implies a certain amount of robustness

In the present paper we first formulate a model for hybrid dynamical systems which covers a very large class of systems and which is suitable for the qualitative analysis of such systems. Next, we introduce the notion of an invariant set (e.g., equilibrium) for hybrid dynamical systems and we define several types of (Lyapunov-like) stability concepts for an invariant set.We then establish sufficient conditions for uniform stability, uniform asymptotic stability, exponential stability, and instability of an invariant set of hybrid dynamical systems. Under some mild additional assumptions, we also establish necessary conditions for some of the above stability types (converse theorems). In addition to the above, we also establish sufficient conditions for the uniform boundedness of the motions of hybrid dynamical systems (Lagrange stability). To demonstrate the applicability of the developed theory, we present specific examples of hybrid dynamical systems and we conduct a stability analysis of some of these examples (a class of sampled- data feedback control systems with a nonlinear (continuous-time) plant and a linear (discrete-time) controller, and a class of systems with impulse effects).},

A camera sensor is modeled using probability of detection. The path
planner uses a variable length horizon planner. The paper uses a
form of cooperation that we have been calling leader following. They
use the term {\&}quot;greedy policy{\&}quot; to describe picking one vehicle and
planning a myoptic optimal path, and then fixing that path and planning
the path for the second vehicle based on the first path. They claim
that this yields a submodular and nondecreasing function.

(BTO) to investigate butterfly flight. Its weight is 0.4 g, wing
span is 140 mm and flapping frequency is 10 Hz. It flies forward
passively. The flights were recorded with a highspeed video camera
and the longitudinal motion of the BTO was analyzed. When the center
of gravity was appropriate, the angle of attack of the body varied
cyclically. We found that the cyclical change of the angle of attack
produced total upward aerodynamic force. Then we visualized air flow
around the BTO both in tethered flight and in free flight. We revealed
that free body motion caused a stable attachment of leading edge
vortex. We also found that the free body motion helped the wings'
smooth upstroke, which was not found in tethered flight.},

	Abstract = {In this paper we describe a scalable algorithm for the simultaneous mapping and localization (SLAM) problem. SLAM is the problem of acquiring a map of a static environment with a mobile robot. The vast majority of SLAM algorithms are based on the extended Kalman filter (EKF). In this paper we advocate an algorithm that relies on the dual of the EKF, the extended information filter (EIF). We show that when represented in the information form, map posteriors are dominated by a small number of links that tie together nearby features in the map. This insight is developed into a sparse variant of the EIF, called the sparse extended information filter (SEIF). SEIFs represent maps by graphical networks of features that are locally interconnected, where links represent relative information between pairs of nearby features, as well as information about the robot's pose relative to the map. We show that all essential update equations in SEIFs can be executed in constant time, irrespective of the size of the map. We also provide empirical results obtained for a benchmark data set collected in an outdoor environment, and using a multi-robot mapping simulation.},

	Abstract = {In order for an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) to safely fly close to the ground, it must be capable of detecting and avoiding obstacles in its flight path. From a single camera on the UAV, the 3D structure of its surrounding environment, including any obstacles, can be estimated from motion parallax using a technique called structure from motion. Most structure from motion algorithms attempt to reconstruct the 3D structure of the environment from a single optical flow value at each feature point. We present a novel method for calculating structure from motion that does not require a precise calculation of optical flow at each feature point. Due to the effects of image noise and the aperture problem, it may be impossible to accurately calculate a single optical flow value at each feature point. Instead we may only be able to calculate a set of likely optical flow values and their associated probabilities or an optical flow probability distribution. Using this probability distribution, a more robust method for calculating structure from motion is developed. This method is being developed for use on a UAV to detect obstacles, but it can be used on any vehicle where obstacle avoidance is needed.},

	Abstract = {Recent advances in many multi-discipline technologies have allowed small, low-cost fixed wing unmanned air vehicles (UAV) or more complicated unmanned ground vehicles (UGV) to be a feasible solution in many scientific, civil and military applications. Cameras can be mounted on-board of the unmanned vehicles for the purpose of scientific data gathering, surveillance for law enforcement and homeland security, as well as to provide visual information to detect and avoid imminent collisions for autonomous navigation. However, most current computer vision algorithms are highly complex computationally and usually constitute the bottleneck of the guidance and control loop. In this paper, we present a novel computer vision algorithm for collision detection and time-to-impact calculation based on feature density distribution (FDD) analysis. It does not require accurate feature extraction, tracking, or estimation of focus of expansion (FOE). Under a few reasonable assumptions, by calculating the expansion rate of the FDD in space, time-to-impact can be accurately estimated. A sequence of monocular images is studied, and different features are used simultaneously in FDD analysis to show that our algorithm can achieve a fairly good accuracy in collision detection. In this paper we also discuss reactive path planning and trajectory generation techniques that can be accomplished without violating the velocity and heading rate constraints of the UAV.},

	Abstract = {A deterministic attitude estimation problem for a rigid body in a potential field, with bounded attitude and angular velocity measurement
errors is considered. An attitude estimation algorithm that globally minimizes the attitude estimation error is obtained. Assuming that the initial
attitude, the initial angular velocity and measurement noise lie within given ellipsoidal bounds, an uncertainty ellipsoid that bounds the attitude
and the angular velocity of the rigid body is obtained. The center of the uncertainty ellipsoid provides point estimates, and the size of the
uncertainty ellipsoid measures the accuracy of the estimates. The point estimates and the uncertainty ellipsoids are propagated using a Lie
group variational integrator and its linearization, respectively. The attitude and angular velocity estimates are optimal in the sense that the sizes
of the uncertainty ellipsoids are minimized.},
	Annote = {The standard approach for attitude estimation is to represent the measurement noise using probabilistic models and the estimate the attitude using a Bayesian Filter. (Kalman filters and particle filters are different instantiations of Bayesian filters.) An alternative approach is to represent the measurement noise using deterministic bounded uncertainties. Primarily for historical reasons, the bounded uncertainty approach has not been pursued and developed, other than in a few isolated papers. In this paper Dr. Sanyal derives an attitude estimation scheme based on bounded uncertainties, where the attitude is represented by a rotation matrix. The result is impressive in that not only is the algorithm derived, but a sufficient condition is also presented that guarantees asymptotic convergence of the estimation error. This is a new alternative to standard methods based on Bayes filters, and I believe that the importance of this paper will increase with time.},

Space vehicle attitude control system performance is often limited
by the computational speed of airborne digital computer hardware.
The applicatio of quaternions to digital attitude control problems
involving coordinate system transformations can reduce computation
time by more than 40{\%} over the equivalent direction cosine matrix
solution due to a new method of treating quaternions which allows
the order of multiplication to be interchanged so as to isolate the
most rapidly varying parameters. This paper presents a formulation
for control equations in which the control error is expressed as
a quaternion and all coordinate system tranformations are performed
using quaterions. The new principle of `quaternion algebra' which
allows interchanging the order of multiplication is developed and
used to simplify the control equations. The quaternion control equations
are applied to a three-gimbal IMU example and the results are compared
to an equivalent direction cosine matrix solution. },

	Abstract = {Abstract This paper describes a new approach for autonomous road following
for an unmanned air vehicle (UAV) using a visual sensor. A road is
defined as any continuous, extended, curvilinear feature, which can
include city streets, highways, and dirt roads, as well as forest-fire
perimeters, shorelines, and fenced borders. To achieve autonomous
road-following, this paper utilizes Proportional Navigation as the
basis for the guidance law, where visual information is directly
fed back into the controller. The tracking target for the Proportional
Navigation algorithm is chosen as the position on the edge of the
camera frame at which the road flows into the image. Therefore, each
frame in the video stream only needs to be searched on the edge of
the frame, thereby significantly reducing the computational requirements
of the computer vision algorithms. The tracking error defined in
the camera reference frame shows that the Proportional Navigation
guidance law results in a steadystate error caused by bends and turns
in the road, which are perceived as road motion. The guidance algorithm
is therefore adjusted using Augmented Proportional NavigationGuidance
to account for the perceived road accelerations and to force the
steady-state error to zero. The effectiveness of the solution is
demonstrated through high-fidelity simulations, and with flight tests
using a small autonomous UAV.},

The comparison is based on experimental results and the cross track error measurements as well as the servo command signals are considered in the analysis. Both the guidance schemes are applied to the underactuated LAUV vehicle in the same environmental conditions with the same speed and heading controllers. The comparison separates between transient and steady-state behaviour, with focus on the latter. In particular, the cross-track error transfer functions for small time varying disturbances are derived for the two guidance schemes at equilibrium and similarities are found with the experimental results. The analysis concludes good path following performance for both the VF and the ILOS guidance laws, with the VF controller performing slightly better. However, the VF guidance scheme su ers from signi cant chattering on the horizontal rudders while the ILOS guidance law gives very smooth servo commands.},

An analysis of the aircraft dynamics and of the flight envelope of the vehicle, encompassing both the hover and the level flight conditions, is proposed in presence of wind disturbances. This analysis is used to derive a control strategy able to enforce the desired transition while maintaining the flight envelope within prescribed sets despite the influence of wind disturbances. To this end, a path following approach is adopted in which the time law is synthesized by a flight envelope protection controller. The paper complements our earlier work (Naldi {\&} Marconi, 2011) in which optimal transition trajectories are computed.

	Abstract = {In this paper we present a prototype system for image based localization in urban environments. Given a database of views of city street scenes tagged by GPS locations, the system computes the GPS location of a novel query view. We first use a wide-baseline matching technique based on SIFT features to select the closest views in the database. Often due to a large change of viewpoint and presence of repetitive structures, a large percentage of matches ({\&}amp;gt; 50{\%}) are not correct correspondences. The subsequent motion estimation between the query view and the reference view, is then handled by a novel and efficient robust estimation technique capable of dealing with large percentage of outliers. This stage is also accompanied by a model selection step among the fundamental matrix and the homography. Once the motion between the closest reference views is estimated, the location of the query view is then obtained by triangulation of translation directions. Approximate solutions for cases when triangulation cannot be obtained reliably are also described. The presented system is tested on the dataset used in ICCV 2005 Computer Vision Contest and is shown to have higher accuracy than previous reported results.},

Comments: A method is described for constructing a feedback control
law which remains optimal for a class of systems with unknown parameters
whose values may lie in given regions. The control depends only on
the input and output, and there is no explicit dependence on the
unknown parameters. In contrast to the usual adaptive strategy, there
is no idenification or adjustment period. The optimal control is
generated in a Taylor series form, but truncation of the series results
in a feedback control which is close to optimal for a range of parameter
values. An nth-order truncation of the control results in a (2n+1)th-order
approximation of the optimally adaptive performance index. },

This paper addresses the formation control problem for multiple nonholonomic
mobile robots. The approach to formation control is primarily leader-following,
but also contains a hint of the behavior approach. It is also very
close to the template architecture. Formation vectors are formed
from a leader and the robots try to track these vectors. Nonholonomic
control laws that force the robot orientation to be time-varying
are used. Extremely *unsatisfactory* robot trajectories are obtained.
A notion of formation controllability is introduced and the robot
formation is shown to be controllable. Analysis of the formation
behavior is accomplished via averaging theory. },

	Abstract = {Abstract Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have the potential to carry
resources

in support of search and prosecute operations. Often to completely
prosecute a

target, UAVs may have to simultaneously attack the target with various
resources

with different capacities. However, the UAVs are capable of carrying
only limited

resources in small quantities, hence, a group of UAVs (coalition)
needs to be assigned

that satisfies the target resource requirement. The assigned coalition
must be

such that it minimizes the target prosecution delay and the size of
the coalition. The

problem of forming coalitions is computationally intensive due to
the combinatorial

nature of the problem, but for real-time applications computationally
cheap solutions

are required. In this paper, we propose decentralized sub-optimal
(polynomial time)

and decentralized optimal coalition formation algorithms that generate
coalitions for

a single target with low computational complexity. We compare the
performance

of the proposed algorithms to that of a global optimal solution for
which we

need to solve a centralized combinatorial optimization problem. This
problem is

computationally intensive because the solution has to (a) provide
a coalition for

each target, (b) design a sequence in which targets need to be prosecuted,
and (c)

take into account reduction of UAV resources with usage. To solve
this problem

we use the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) technique. Through simulations,
we

study the performance of the proposed algorithms in terms of mission
performance,

complexity of the algorithms and the time taken to form the coalition.
The simulation

results show that the solution provided by the proposed algorithms
is close to the

global optimal solution and requires far less computational resources.},

The probability hypothesis density (PHD) filter is a recursion that propagates the posterior intensity function-a 1st-order moment-of the random set of multiple targets in time. Like the Bayesian single-target filter, the PHD recursion also suffers from the curse of dimensionality. Although sequential Monte Carlo implementations have demonstrated the potential of the PHD filter, so far no closed-form solutions have yet been developed. In this paper, an analytic solution to the PHD recursion is proposed for linear Gaussian target dynamics with Gaussian births.

	Abstract = { Location: shelf Keywords: Approximation theory, Stochastic systems,
suboptimal control, nonlinear systems, Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation
Comments: Theoretical procedures are developed for camparing the
performance of arbitrarily selected admissible feedback controls
amoung themselves with the optimal solution of a nonlinear optimal
stochastic control problem. Iterative design schemes are proposed
for successively improving the performance of a controller until
a satisfactory design is achieved. Specifically, the exact design
procedure is based on the generalized Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation
of the cost function of nonlinear stochastic systems, and teh approximate
design procedure for the infinite-time nonlinear stochastic regulator
problem, is developed by using the upper and lower bounds of the
cost functions. Stability of this problem is also considered. For
a given controller, both the upper and lower bounds to its cost function
can be obtained by solving a partial differential inequality. These
bounds, constructed without actually knowing the optimal controller,
are used as measure to evaluate the acceptability of suboptimal controllers.
These results establish an approximation theory of optimal stochastic
control and provide a practical procedure for selecting effective
practical controls for nonlinear stochastic systems. An Entropy reformulation
of the Generalized Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation is also presented.

	Abstract = {In this paper we derive two classes of flight trajectories for tracking
ground based objects with micro air vehicles. The first class of
flight trajectories, called longitudinal trajectories, consists of
switching between clockwise and counter clockwise orbits so that
the average velocity of the MAV along the direction of motion is
equal to the velocity of the ground target. The second class of flight
trajectories, called orbital trajectories, consists of orbits and
straight line motions. Longitudinal trajectories are shown to have
advantages when the ground speed of the target is close to the ground
speed of the MAV. Orbital trajectories are better for relatively
slow targets. As a final result, we show that the optimal switching
ratio is an inherent property of this class of flight trajectories.

	Abstract = {This paper considers the problem of obtaining good attitude estimates from measurements obtained from typical low cost inertial measurement units. The outputs of such systems are characterized by high noise levels and time varying additive biases. We formulate the filtering problem as deterministic observer kinematics posed directly on the special orthogonal group SO (3) driven by reconstructed attitude and angular velocity measurements. Lyapunov analysis results for the proposed observers are derived that ensure almost global stability of the observer error. The approach taken leads to an observer that we term the direct complementary filter. By exploiting the geometry of the special orthogonal group a related observer, termed the passive complementary filter, is derived that decouples the gyro measurements from the reconstructed attitude in the observer inputs. Both the direct and passive filters can be extended to estimate gyro bias online. The passive filter is further developed to provide a formulation in terms of the measurement error that avoids any algebraic reconstruction of the attitude. This leads to an observer on SO(3), termed the explicit complementary filter, that requires only accelerometer and gyro outputs; is suitable for implementation on embedded hardware; and provides good attitude estimates as well as estimating the gyro biases online. The performance of the observers are demonstrated with a set of experiments performed on a robotic test-bed and a radio controlled unmanned aerial vehicle.},

	Abstract = {Abstract---The application range of UAVs (unmanned aerial
vehicles) is expanding along with performance upgrades. Vertical
take-off and landing (VTOL) aircraft has the merits of
both fixed-wing and rotary-wing aircraft. Tail-sitting is the
simplest way for the VTOL maneuver since it does not need
extra actuators. However, conventional hovering control for
a tail-sitter UAV is not robust enough against large disturbance
such as a blast of wind, a bird strike, and so on. It
is experimentally observed that the conventional quaternion
feedback hovering control often fails to keep stability when the
control compensates large attitude errors. This paper proposes
a novel hovering control strategy for a tail-sitter VTOL UAV
that increases stability against large disturbance. In order to
verify the proposed hovering control strategy, simulations and
experiments on hovering of the UAV are performed giving large
attitude errors. The results show that the proposed control
strategy successfully compensates initial large attitude errors
keeping stability, while the conventional quaternion feedback
controller fails.},
	Address = {Anchorage, Alaska},
	Annote = {This paper describes why quaternion feedback should not be used for a tailsitter UAV. The basic reason is that the quaterion error is not necessarily resolved along the roll, pitch, and yaw axes of the aircraft in a natural way, especially for large attitude errors.


As an alternative, they propose an alternative scheme which they call the resolved tilt-twist angle feedback control and projects the error along the natural roll, pitch, and yaw angles of the aircraft.


Quaternion feedback results in the smallest possible rotation angles, which is good for spacecraft, but not natural for aircraft. The resolved tilt-twist method results in more natural motion for aircraft and should probably always be used.

Complex formation maneuvers are decomposed into a sequence of maneuvers between formation patterns. The paper presents three formation control strategies. The first strategy uses relative position information configured in a bidirectional ring topology to maintain the formation. The second strategy injects interrobot damping via passivity techniques. The third strategy accounts for actuator saturation. Hardware results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control strategies.},

introduction to modeling, estimation,

aerial vehicles that includes
the common four-rotor or quadrotor
case.
Aerial robotics is a fast-growing
field of robotics and multirotor aircraft,
such as the quadrotor (Figure
1), are rapidly growing in
popularity. In fact, quadrotor aerial
robotic vehicles have become a
standard platform for robotics
research worldwide. They already
have sufficient payload and flight
endurance to support a number of
indoor and outdoor applications,
and the improvements of battery
and other technology is rapidly
increasing the scope for commercial
opportunities. They are highly maneuverable
and enable safe and
low-cost experimentation in mapping,
navigation, and control strategies for
robots that move in three-dimensional
(3-D) space. This ability to move in 3-D
space brings new research challenges compared
with the wheeled mobile robots that
have driven mobile robotics research over the
last decade. Small quadrotors have been demonstrated
for exploring and mapping 3-D environments;
transporting, manipulating, and assembling
objects; and acrobatic tricks such as juggling, balancing,
and flips. Additional rotors can be added, leading to generalized
N-rotor vehicles, to improve payload and reliability.},

	Abstract = {Abstract---This paper presents a unified, formal framework
to help analyze and model human guidance behavior. In this
framework, the guidance behavior is analyzed as the closed-loop
dynamics of the whole agent-environment system. The resulting
coupled agent-environment dynamics give rise to interaction
patterns. The central hypothesis is that these patterns, which
can be explained in terms of invariances inherent to closed-loop
behavior, provide the building blocks for the organization of
behavior. The paper first describes these concepts using a toy
model and then details the technique that was developed for
the analysis of experimental data collected using a miniature
helicopter in agile human guidance experiments. The results
confirm that human guidance behavior indeed exhibits invariances
as defined by interaction patterns. The behavior in each
interaction pattern is then investigated using piecewise linear
model identification. Combined these two steps provide a natural
and formal decomposition of the behavior that can be unified
under a hybrid automaton.},

The idea of using similar trajectories is in keeping with Dr. Mettler{\&}{\#}039;s other work on motion primitives, and represents the common thread through most of her work. While this paper does not solve all of the issues that need to be addressed, it does represent an interesting and very reasonable approach to the problem.

We pose the problem of finding the best vertex positional configuration in the presence of an additional proximity constraint, in the sense that, the second smallest eigenvalue of the corresponding graph Laplacian is maximized. In many recent applications of algebraic graph theory in systems and control, the second smallest eigenvalue of Laplacian has emerged as a critical parameter that influences the stability and robustness properties of dynamic systems that operate over an information network. Our motivation in the present work is to "assign" this Laplacian eigenvalue when relative positions of various elements dictate the interconnection of the underlying weighted graph. In this venue, one would then be able to "synthesize" information graphs that have desirable system theoretic properties.},

	Abstract = { A method is discussed for estimating the state of a linear dynamic system using noisy observations, when the input to the dynamic system and the observation errors are completely unknown except for bounds on their magnitude or energy. The state estimate is actually a set in state space rather than a single vector. The optimum estimate is the smallest calculable set which contains the unknown system state, but it is usually impractical to calculate this set. A recursive algorithm is developed which calculates a time-varying ellipsoid in state space that always contains the system's true state. Unfortunately the algorithm is still unproven in the sense that its performance has not yet been evaluated. The algorithm is closely related in structure but not in performance to the algorithm obtained when the system inputs and observation errors are white Gaussian processes. The algorithm development is motivated by the problem of tracking an evasive target, but the results have wider applications.},

	Abstract = {This paper considers the problem of obtaining good attitude estimates from measurements obtained from typical low cost inertial measurement units. The outputs of such systems are characterized by high noise levels and time varying additive biases. We formulate the filtering problem as deterministic observer kinematics posed directly on the special orthogonal group SO (3) driven by reconstructed attitude and angular velocity measurements. Lyapunov analysis results for the proposed observers are derived that ensure almost global stability of the observer error. The approach taken leads to an observer that we term the direct complementary filter. By exploiting the geometry of the special orthogonal group a related observer, termed the passive complementary filter, is derived that decouples the gyro measurements from the reconstructed attitude in the observer inputs. Both the direct and passive filters can be extended to estimate gyro bias online. The passive filter is further developed to provide a formulation in terms of the measurement error that avoids any algebraic reconstruction of the attitude. This leads to an observer on SO(3), termed the explicit complementary filter, that requires only accelerometer and gyro outputs; is suitable for implementation on embedded hardware; and provides good attitude estimates as well as estimating the gyro biases online. The performance of the observers are demonstrated with a set of experiments performed on a robotic test-bed and a radio controlled unmanned aerial vehicle.},

	Abstract = {Abstractï¿½The use of accelerometer and gyro observations

in a visual SLAM implementation is beneficial especially in

high dynamic situations. The downside of using inertial is that

traditionally high prediction rates are required as observations

are provided at high sample rates. An accurate orientation and

velocity estimate must also be maintained at all times in order

to integrate the inertial observations and correct for the effect

of gravity.

This paper presents a way to pre-integrate the high rate

inertial observations without the need for an initial orientation

or velocity estimate. This allows for a slower filter prediction

rate and use of inertial observations when the initial velocity

and attitude of the platform are unknown. Additionally the

initial velocity and roll and pitch of the platform become

observable over time and an estimate of these values is provided

by the filter. An estimate of the gravity vector is also provided.

Results are presented using a delayed state information

smoother implementation however due to the linearity of the

equations this technique can be applied to extended Kalman

filter (EKF) implementations just as easily.},

obtained using the information consensus filter are equivalent to
the estimated map produced in a centralized filter; this fact is
shown analytically and verified by simulation. Furthermore, we compare

@article{Civera2009,
	Abstract = {Recently, classical pairwise Structure From Motion (SfM) techniques have been combined with non-linear global optimization (Bundle Adjustment, BA) over a sliding window to recursively provide camera pose and feature location estimation from long image sequences. Normally called Visual Odometry, these algorithms are nowadays able to estimate with impressive accuracy trajectories of hundreds of meters; either from an image sequence (usually stereo) as the only input, or combining visual and propioceptive information from inertial sensors or wheel odometry. This paper has a double objective. First, we aim to illustrate for the first time how similar accuracy and trajectory length can be achieved by filtering-based visual SLAM methods. Specifically, a camera-centered Extended Kalman Filter is used here to process a monocular sequence as the only input, with 6DOF motion estimated. Features are kept live in the filter while visible as the camera explores forward, and are deleted from the state once they go out of view. This permits an increase in the number of tracked features per frame from tens to around a hundred. While improving the accuracy of the estimation, it makes computationally infeasible the exhaustive Branch and Bound search performed by standard JCBB for match outlier rejection. As a second contribution that overcomes this problem, we present here a RANSAC-like algorithm that exploits the probabilistic prediction of the filter. This use of prior information makes it possible to reduce the size of the minimal data subset to instantiate a hypothesis to the minimum possible of 1 point, greatly increasing the efficiency of the outlier rejection stage. Experimental results from real image sequences covering trajectories of hundreds of meters are presented and compared against RTK GPS ground truth. Estimation errors are about 1{\%} of the trajectory for trajectories up to 650 metres.},

	Abstract = {Abstract---Collision detection and estimation from a monocular visual
sensor is an important enabling technology for safe navigation of
small or micro air vehicles in near earth flight. In this paper,
we introduce a new approach called expansion segmentation, which
simultaneously detects ``collision danger regions'' of significant
positive divergence in inertial aided video, and estimates maximum
likelihood time to collision (TTC) in a correspondenceless framework
within the danger regions. This approach was motivated from a literature
review which showed that existing approaches make strong assumptions
about scene structure or camera motion, or pose collision detection
without determining obstacle boundaries, both of which limit the
operational envelope of a deployable system. Expansion segmentation
is based on a new formulation of 6- DOF inertial aided TTC estimation,
and a new derivation of a first order TTC uncertainty model due to
subpixel quantization error and epipolar geometry uncertainty. Proof
of concept results are shown in a custom designed urban flight simulator
and on operational flight data from a small air vehicle.},

	Abstract = {Autopilot systems are capable of reliably following flight plans under normal circumstances, but even the most advanced flight-management systems cannot provide robust response to most anomalous events including in-flight failures. This paper describes an emergency flight-management architecture that can be applied to piloted or autonomous aircraft, with focus on the design and implementation of an adaptive flight planner (AFP) that dynamically adjusts its model to compute feasible flight plans in response to events that degrade aircraft performance. A two-step landing-site selection/trajectory generation process defines safe emergency plans in real time for situations that require landing at an alternate airport. A constraint-based search algorithm selects and prioritizes feasible emergency landing sites, then the AFP synthesizes a segmented trajectory to the best site based on postfailure flight dynamics. The AFP architecture is general for any failure situation; however, operational success is guaranteed only with accurate postfailure performance characterization and a trajectory generation strategy that respects degraded flight envelope boundaries. A real-time segmented trajectory planning algorithm and case study results are presented for total loss of thrust failure scenarios. This emergency is surprisingly common and necessitates an immediate approach and landing without a go-around option.},

@article{Merwe2001,
	Abstract = {Over the last 20-30 years, the extended Kalman filter (EKF) has
become the algorithm of choice in numerous nonlinear estimation and
machine learning applications. These include estimating the state of a
nonlinear dynamic system as well estimating parameters for nonlinear
system identification (eg, learning the weights of a neural network).
The EKF applies the standard linear Kalman filter methodology to a
linearization of the true nonlinear system. This approach is
sub-optimal, and can easily lead to divergence. Julier et al. (1997),
proposed the unscented Kalman filter (UKF) as a derivative-free
alternative to the extended Kalman filter in the framework of state
estimation. This was extended to parameter estimation by Wan and Van der
Merwe et al., (2000). The UKF consistently outperforms the EKF in terms
of prediction and estimation error, at an equal computational complexity
of (OL<sup>3</sup>)<sup>l</sup> for general state-space problems. When
the EKF is applied to parameter estimation, the special form of the
state-space equations allows for an O(L<sup>2</sup>) implementation.
This paper introduces the square-root unscented Kalman filter (SR-UKF)
which is also O(L<sup>3</sup>) for general state estimation and
O(L<sup>2</sup>) for parameter estimation (note the original formulation
of the UKF for parameter-estimation was O(L<sup>3</sup>)). In addition,
the square-root forms have the added benefit of numerical stability and
guaranteed positive semi-definiteness of the state covariances},

@article{John2011,
	Abstract = {Ducted fan vehicles possess a superior ability to maximize payload capacity while minimizing vehicle size. Their ability to both hover and fly at high speed is a key advantage for information-gathering missions, particularly when close proximity to a target is essential. However, the ducted fans aerodynamic characteristics pose difficulties for stable vehicle flight and therefore require complex control algorithms. In particular, they exhibit a large nose-up pitching moment during wind gusts and when transitioning from hover to forward flight. Understanding ducted fan aerodynamic behavior and how it can be altered through flow control techniques are the two prime objectives of this work. This dissertation provides a new paradigm for modeling the ducted fans nonlinear behavior and new methods for changing the duct aerodynamics using active flow control. Steady and piezoelectric synthetic jet blowing are employed in the flow control concepts and are compared. The new aerodynamic model captures the nonlinear characteristics of the force, moment, and power data for a ducted fan, while representing these terms in a set of simple equations. The model attains excellent agreement with current and legacy experimental data using twelve non- dimensional constants. Synthetic jet actuators (SJA) have potential for use in flow control applications in UAVs with limited size, weight, and power budgets. Piezoelectric SJAs for a ducted fan vehicle were developed through two rounds of experimental designs. The final SJA design attained peak jet velocities in the range of 225 ft/sec (69 m/s) for a 0.03 x 0.80 rectangular slot. To reduce the magnitude of the nose-up pitching moment in cross-winds, two flow control concepts were explored: flow separation control at the duct lip, and flow turning at the duct trailing edge using a Coand surface. Both concepts were experimentally proven to be successful. Synthetic jets and steady jets were capable of modifying the ducted fan flow to reduce pitching moment, but some cases required high values of steady blowing to create significant responses. Triggering leading edge separation on the duct lip was one application where synthetic jets showed comparable performance to steady jets operating at a blowing coefficient an order of magnitude higher.},

is computationally intensive and the second is based on 3D

the second approach, the computational time is very low and

the strategy can be implemented for real-time path planning

problems. Unlike the existing iterative methods which yield

suboptimal paths and are computationally more intensive, this

geometrical method generates an optimal path in lesser time.

Due to its simplicity and low computational requirements this

approach can be implemented on fixed wing aerial vehicles with

mobile robots coordination nonholonomic robots reachability graphs
Comments: This is a nice paper on using virtual structures for formation
control. The basic idea is to treat the formation as a virtual structure,
with the desired positions of the robots as points within the virtual
structure. A formal definition of a virtual structure is given. The
control algorithm operates by first moving the virtual structure
(VS), then moving the robots to conform the the VS, and finally least
square fitting the virtual structure to the final robot positions.
Feedback to the formation is thereby explicitly encoded into the
algorithm. Another clever idea presented in the paper is that of
reachability graphs for mobile robots. The nodes of possible VS positions
are constrained to lie within the reachability graphs of each, thereby
ensuring that the required motion of each robot is feasible. Several
simulation and experimental scenarios are described including translation,
rotation, robot failure and docking. Formation errors on the order
of 1cm are obtained. The paper also contains a nice literature survey,
and a summary of the advantages of the virtual structure approach.},

takes the form of a linear combination of functions of the state,
each positively homogeneous of degree 2p-1 (p>1/2); whereas the control
law for the reaction jets is of bang-bang form. The range (of the

The system is integrated around a spatial, state-dependent cost-to-go (SVF) function that is computed as an approximation to the value function associated with the optimal trajectory planning problem. The function captures the critical interaction between the vehicle dynamics and environment, thereby resulting in tighter coupling between planning and control. The consistency achieved between the RH optimization and the SVF enables a more rigorous implementation of the RH framework to autonomous vehicle guidance. The paper describes the overall approach along flight experimental results obtained in an Interactive Guidance and Control Laboratory. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

	Abstract = { Location: Ref DB 12 shelf Keywords: formation flying spacecraft interferometry
leader following hybrid control switching linear matrix inequalities
LMI Comments: This paper presents some clever results for multiple
spacecraft formation flying. The main contributions of the paper
are as follows: - A clean mathematical notation for leader-following,
including a nice application of graph theoretic results, - New control
laws for formation flying control based in LMI's, - A stability analysis
for leader reassignment, - New hybrid control laws for formation
control that avoid control saturation.

The notation introduced by the author is very clean and will probably
set a standard for future papers in formation control.

The new control laws based on LMI's are only a small contribution,
and do not add much to the understanding of formation control.

Leader reassignment is a big issue in formation control. If a leader-following
architecture is used, then failure of the leader could compromise
the entire mission. Robustness demands the possibility of leader
reassignment. The discussion in the current paper is good, however
I wonder about the usefulness of the example presented in Figure{\~{}}6,
where the follower is circling the leader. Suppose that we desire
spacecraft {\#}2 to circle spacecraft {\#}1 independent of who is currently
assigned as the leader. It is unclear whether the method proposed
by the authors is applicable to this case.

One of the major disadvantages to leader-following control is that
the acceleration of the leader is used in the control law of the
followers. As a result, acceleration of the leader may cause saturation
of the followers controls. This paper presents a nice solution to
this problem, based on switching and LMI's. While stability of the
overall hybrid scheme is addressed, it is unclear how the resulting
scheme affects the ability of the followers to maintain formation.
Intuitively, the switching mechanism must reduce the gain of the
followers control, which will reduce the achievable performance of
the controls. One criticism of the presentation is that the authors
do not offer any intuition about the action of the control. I would
suggest adding a few (non-mathematical) digressions to give the reader
a feel for how the proposed control laws address the saturation problem.

presence of environmental uncertainties is critical to the success

is

by learning a model of the environment through Bayesian inference,

model to improve the predictive capability of the planning algorithm.
Traditional

parametric models of the environment however, can be ineective if
the data cannot

be explained using an a priori xed set of parameters. In nonparametric
Bayesian

models (NPBMs), on the other hand, the number of parameters grows
in response

to the data. This paper investigates the use of NPBMs in the context

under uncertainty. Two illustrative planning examples are used to
demonstrate

that the additional

of certain stabilizing functions. It is well documented

that, as the order of a nonlinear system increases, analytic

calculation of these derivatives becomes prohibitive. Therefore,

in practice, either alternative control approaches are

used or the derivatives are neglected in the implementation.

Neglecting the derivatives results in the loss of all

guarantees proven by Lyapunov methods for the adaptive

backstepping approach and may result in instability.

This article presents a new implementation approach

for adaptive backstepping control. The main objectives

are to facilitate the derivation and implementation of

the adaptive backstepping approach, with performance

guarantees proven by Lyapunov methods, for applications

that were prohibitively difficult using the standard analytic

implementation approach. The new approach uses filtering

methods to produce certain command signals and their

derivatives which eliminates the requirement of analytic

differentiation. The approach also introduces filters to generated

certain compensating signals necessary to compute

compensated tracking errors suitable for adaptive parameter

estimation. We present a set of Lemmas and Theorems

to analyze the performance both during the initialization

and the operating phases. We show that the initialization

phase is of finite duration that can be controlled by selection

of a design parameter. We also show that all signals within

the system are bounded during this short initialization

phase. During the operating phase, we show that the

command filtered implementation approach has theoretical

properties identical to those of the conventional approach.

The general approach is presented and analyzed for

systems in generalized parameter strict feedback form.

Extensions of the approach are presented to demonstrate

the application of the method to a land vehicle trajectory

following application. Application and effectiveness of the

proposed method is shown by simulation results.},

In a family of nonlinear optimal control problems, equivalence classes
of problems that yield identical optimal closed-loop systems are
delineated. The equivlence relations are established as one-to-one
correspondences between the solutions of the Hamilton-Jacobi equations
associated with the problems. Two such equivalence relations are
presented. These allow an arbitrary problem in the family to be reduced
to an equivalent basic standard form of problem. Also, a new formal
procedure for solving this basic problem is given that allows the
determination of coefficients in the series expansion of the optimal
closed-loop system. The set of algebraic equations to be solved is
considerably simpler than that derived by other methods. },

	Abstract = { Location: Ref DB 2 Keywords: Finite Element, State space reductions,
model reduction, balanced realization Comments: In the dynamics modeling
of a structure, finite element analysis employs reduction techniques,
such as Guyan's reduction, that remove some of the insignificant
physical coordinates, that is, degrees of freedom at a node point.
Despite such reduction, the resultant model is still too large for
control design. This warrents further reduction as is frequently
done in control design by approximating a large dynamical systm with
a fewer number of state variables. A problem, however, arises because
a model usually undergoes, before being reduced, some form of coordinate
transformations that destroy the physical meaning of the states.
To correct such a problem, we developed a method that expresses a
reduced model in terms of a subset of the original states. The proposed
method starts with a dynamic model that is originated and reduced
in finite element analysis. The model is then converted to a state-space
form, and reduced further by the internal balancing method. At this
stage, being in the balanced coordinate system, the states in the
reduced model have no apparent resemblance to those of the original
model. Through another coordinate transformation that is developed
in this paper, however, this reduced model is expressed by a subset
of the original states, so that the states in the reduced model can
be related to the degrees of freedom of the nodes in the original
finite element model. },

	Abstract = {Unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) will be required to equip with sense-and-avoid (SAA) systems in order to fulfill the regulatory requirement to remain ``well clear'' of other air
traffic. This study investigates the effects that different well-clear metrics have on the rate of
well-clear violations and evaluates the distribution of distances between aircraft at a wellclear
violation in high-altitude enroute airspace. The first analysis determines the predicted
rate at which violations of well clear would occur between UAS and manned aircraft
operating under instrument flight rules, indicating the frequency with which a sense-andavoid
system would create a nuisance alert. This analysis is done both with and without an
algorithmic model of air traffic control (ATC) separation provision services. The second
analysis determines the relationship between time-based well-clear metrics and the range at
which the violation would occur, a relationship that may inform the required SAA
surveillance range and the frequency with which violations would occur despite ATC
separation standards still being maintained. The analyses are carried out using a fast-time
simulation capability of the entire US air traffic system over a single day, including 3000
UAS and more than 50,000 manned aircraft. Results indicate that, without any separation
provision, a UAS would encounter a manned aircraft with a range tau (defined as the ratio
of the relative range to range rate) of 60 seconds only every six hours. Approximately 75{\%}
of such encounters would occur outside the ATC separation standard of 5 nmi.},

Path planning and obstacle avoidance for MAVs involve planning a feasible path from an initial state to a goal state while avoiding obstacles in the environment. This paper presents a vision-based local multi-resolution mapping and path planning technique for MAVs using a forward-looking onboard camera. A depth map, which represents the time-to-collision (TTC) and bearing information of the obstacles, is obtained by computer vision algorithms. To account for measurement uncertainties introduced by the camera, a multi-resolution map in the body frame of the MAV is created in polar coordinates. Using the depth map, the locations of the obstacles are determined in the multi-resolution map. Dijkstra's algorithm is employed to find a collision-free path in the body frame. The simulation and flight test results show that the proposed technique is successful in solving path planning and multiple obstacles avoidance problems for MAVs.},

the limitations of a typical EKF magnetometer measurement

presents a method for recovering MAVs in flight using a mothership

places the drogue in a stable, slower orbit that can be tracked by
a MAV. The differential flatness property of the system is exploited
to calculate mothership trajectories from desired drogue orbits,

In this paper, some new theoretical results are presented on the Joint Probabilistic Data Association (JPDA) algorithm, in which joint posterior probabilities are computed for multiple targets in Poisson clutter. The algorithm is applied to a passive sonar tracking problem wlth multiple sensors and targets, in which a target is not fully observable from a single sensor. Targets are modeled with four geographic states, two or more acoustic states, and realistic (i.e. low) probabilities of detection at each sample time. Simulation results are presented for two heavily interfering targets; these illustrate the dramatic improvements obtained by computing joint probabilities.},

	Abstract = {These notes provide a brief introduction to the theory of noncooperative differential games. After the Introduction, Section 2 reviews the theory of static games. Differentc oncepts of solution are discussed, including Pareto optima, Nash and Stackelberg equilibria, and the co-co (cooperative-competitive) solutions. Section 3 introduces the basic framework of differential games for two players. Open-loop solutions, where the controls implemented by the players depend only on time, are considered in Section 4. It is shownthat Nash and Stackelberg solutions can be computed by solving a two-point boundary value problem for a system of ODEs, derived from the Pontryagin maximum principle.Section 5 deals with solutions in feedback form, where the controls are allowed to depend on time and also on the current state of the system. In this case, the search for Nash equilibrium solutions usually leads to a highly nonlinear system of Hamilton Jacobi PDEs. In dimension higher than one, this system is generically not hyperbolic and the Cauchy problem is thus ill posed. Due to this instability, closed-loop solutions to differential games are mainly considered in the special case with linear dynamics and quadratic costs. In Section 6, a game in continuous time is approximated by a finite sequence of static games, by a time discretization. Depending of the type of solution adopted in each static game, one obtains different concept of solutions for the original differential game. Section 7 deals with differential games in infinite time horizon, with exponentially discounted payoffs. In this case, the search for Nash solutions in feedback form leads to a system of time-independent H-J equations. Section 8 contains a simple example of a game with infinitely many players. This is intended to convey a flavor of the newly emerging theory of mean field games. Modeling issues, and directions of current research, are briefly discussed in Section 9. Finally, the Appendix collects background material on multivalued functions, selections and fixed point theorems, optimal control theory, and hyperbolic PDEs.},

Systems (UAS) awarded a contract for the Extended Range

Multipurpose (ERMP) Unmanned Aerial System (UAS) to

General Atomics Aeronautical Systems Inc (GA-ASI),

nicknamed the "Warrior." Given the size, performance, range

and endurance of the system, the Warrior system can be

reasonably expected to operate within and require access to the

National Airspace (NAS) and/or unrestricted airspace of host

nations. Therefore, it must have posses an equivalent level of

safety to that of a manned aircraft. Our project involves

identifying sense and avoid requirements necessary to avoid

collisions and potential technologies necessary for the Warrior

ERMP to obtain routine access to the NAS. We evaluate SAA

requirements and define criteria specific to the Warrior

consistent with FAA guidelines. We then show potential

technologies to meet SAA requirements specific to the airframe.

Finally, our research submits a recommendations for the Army

in its pursuit of effective sense and avoid technology. We used

standard systems engineering practices to complete this project

for our client.},

	Abstract = {Abstract---Collision avoidance systems play an important role in

the future of aviation safety. Before new technologies on board

manned or unmanned aircraft are deployed, rigorous analysis

using encounter simulations is required to prove system

robustness. These simulations rely on models that accurately

reflect the geometries and dynamics of aircraft encounters at

close range. These types of encounter models have been

developed by several organizations since the early 1980s. Lincoln

Laboratory's newer encounter models, however, provide a

higher-fidelity representation of encounters, are based on

substantially more data, leverage a theoretical framework for

finding optimal model structures, and reflect recent changes in

the airspace.

Three categories of encounter model were developed by Lincoln

Laboratory. Two of these categories are used for modeling

conventional aircraft; one involving encounters with prior air

traffic control intervention and one without. The third category

of encounter model is for encounters with unconventional

aircraft---such as gliders, skydivers, balloons, and airships---that

typically do not carry transponders. Together, these encounter

models are being used to examine the safety and effectiveness of

aircraft collision avoidance systems and as a foundation for

algorithms for future manned and unmanned systems.},

This paper considers two problems which at first sight appear

to be quite distinct: localizing a robot in an unknown

environment and calibrating an embedded sensor network.

We show that both of these can be formulated as special

cases of a generalized localization problem. In the standard

localization problem, the aim is to determine the pose

of some object (usually a mobile robot) relative to a global

coordinate system. In our generalized version, the aim is

to determine the pose of all elements in a network (both

fixed and mobile) relative to an arbitrary global coordinate

system. We have developed a physically inspired `meshbased'

formalism for solving such problems. This paper

outlines the formalism, and describes its application to the

concrete tasks of multi-robot mapping and calibration of a

distributed sensor network. The paper presents experimental

results for both tasks obtained using a set of Pioneer

mobile robots equipped with scanning laser range-finders},

@article{Stolle2003,
	Abstract = {An Unmanned Autonomous Vehicle (UAV) is equipped with a nose-mounted camera capable of pan and tilt rotation for the observation of ground targets. The two camera angles are adjusted automatically in order to keep the target in the camera's field of view. While the camera actuators are fast enough to keep up with vehicle motion, the limited range of the camera angles leads to the target getting out of sight. Therefore, target exposure is affected by wind. Furthermore, the relative position of the sun can lead to glare and image overexposure. While the effect of wind can be improved by commanding a sideslip angle, image overexposure is avoided by keeping the vehicle between sun and target. Thus, it is desirable of define maneuvers that result in maximum target exposure, and provide guidance laws to allow path following for these maneuvers. This paper presents initial results, obtained based on circular and elliptical maneuvers. The results were generated using an accurate non-linear Aerosonde UAV representation and environmental dynamic models. Simulated GPS data was used for the path following guidance. The complete path about the target at constant altitude and airspeed is specified simply by the desired orbital segment and course reversals at the segment boundaries. With camera pan limited to the forward 180{\&}amp;deg;, this can achieve long term observation. A camera with minor 'look-back' range can provide continuous observation in a maneuver that employs both circular and elliptical segments.},

	Abstract = {An essential determinant of the value of surrogate digital images
is their quality. Image quality measurement has become crucial for
most image processing applications. Over the past years, there have
been many attempts to develop models or metrics for image quality
that incorporate elements of human visual sensitivity. However, there
is no current standard and objective definition of spectral image
quality. This paper proposes a reliable automatic method for objective
image quality measurement by local spatial-frequency wavelet analysis.
The analysis is performed locally by dividing an image into 64664
pixel blocks, and transforming the data into wavelet domain and sub-band
image domain. A fast lifting wavelet algorithm is developed for computationally
efficient spatialfrequency deconstruction of images to extract the
features of edges in sub-band datasets. Wavelet analysis throughout
the spatial-frequency range with respect to noise, sharpness, brightness,
contrast, and modulation transfer function (MTF) reveals more detailed
information to relate the quality of an image to the interpretation
by using an artificial neural network to optimize weightings and
results in a promising quantitative measure of image quality. Experimental
results from using this method for image quality measurement exhibit
good correlation to subjective visual quality assessments. The proposed
approach with fast computation provides a potential metric for reliable
image quality quantification, allowing image quality to be automatically
evaluated following image capture/compression, but prior to permanent
storage in a database.},

results in flight paths that are elliptical trajectories. We also
show that if the target is

allowed to move in the image plane, circular orbits are possible.

difficulties when designing a feedback control. Motivated by a

fixed-speed, fixed-altitude Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) that

tracks an unpredictable target, we seek to control the turning

rate of a planar Dubins vehicle. We introduce stochasticity in

the problem by assuming the target performs a random walk,

which both aides in the computation of a smooth value function

and further accounts for all realizations of target kinematics.

A Bellman equation based on an approximating Markov chain

that is consistent with the stochastic kinematics is used to

compute a control policy that minimizes the expected value of

a cost function based on a nominal UAV-target distance. Our

results indicate how uncertainty in the target motion affects

the control law, and simulations illustrate that the control can

further be applied to any continuous, smooth trajectory with

no need for further computation.},

If the signal to noise ratio is large, this works fine. When the signal to noise ratio is small, then need to use track-before-detect methods that use the raw sensor measurements.

- This paper assumes a point model for the target.
- Also assumes that only one target is present in the sensor field of view. (This is an important distinction between track-before-detect and R-RANSAC).
- birth and death rates of the targets are model explicitly but the birth and death probabilities are assumed to be known.
- the intensity of the target in the image is also assumed to be known.},

	Abstract = {Path planning for satellite slew manoeuvres is considered as an optimal
control problem. The goal is to

design rapid manoeuvres with the resting time vibrational modes as
short as possible in order to provide more

time for space imagery. This problem of optimal time and control effort
is addressed using differential flatness

and B-spline collocation. The flatness allows for reformulating the
original optimal control problem as a tractable

geometric programming problem with no numerical integration, and with
a minimal number of decision variables.

A direct consequence of flatness is that the transformed constraints
describe generally a non-convex subspace. In

the proposed approach, a flat suboptimal convex problem is derived
by means of offline convex approximations

of the feasible space and a measure of its conservatism is given.
Numerical results are discussed and compared

with the results generated from an in-service industrial path planner
available at the French Space Agency, CNES.},

a notion of group flatness, which is simply differential flatness
for a group of vehicles. Formation constraints are introduced as
intervehicle constraints. Two types of control laws are used to track
the resulting flat trajectories: (1) feedforward (open loop) trajectories
and then recompute every two seconds. (2)lqr for tracking flat trajectories:
regenerate trajectories every 2.5 seconds.

The introduction of formation maneuvers is somewhat awkward, and
even though the planned trajectories are collision free, the actual
trajectories may collide.

This is also something that we should be able to integrate into our
approach.},

using local-level frame mapping and planning in spherical coordinates. To explicitly address the obstacle initialization problem,
the maps are parameterized using the inverse time-to-collision
(TTC). Using bearing-only measurements, an extended Kalman
filter is employed to estimate the inverse TTC, azimuth, and
elevation to obstacles. Nonlinear observability analysis is used
to derive conditions for the observability of the system. Based
on these conditions, we design a path planning algorithm that
simultaneously minimizes the uncertainties in state estimation
while avoiding collisions with obstacles. The behavior of the
planning algorithm is analyzed, and the characteristics of the
environment in which the planning algorithm is guaranteed to
generate collision-free paths for MAVs are described. Numerical
results show that the proposed method is successful in solving
the path planning problem for MAVs.},

	Abstract = {This paper addresses distributed target tracking and estimation using
multiple mobile

agents whose dynamics are subject to uncertainties and disturbances.
A consensus-based

distributed estimator is applied to estimate the motion of the target.
To compensate for

the uncertainties in the dynamics and prevent them from propagating
into the commu-

nication network, a cascaded control structure is proposed, which
uses the L1 adaptive

controller to drive the real uncertain system to an ideal closed-loop
system obtained from

an existing

ocking algorithm. Since the communication graph is induced by the
position

of the real agents, we cannot exactly implement the ideal

ocking algorithm, which leads to

coupling between the communication topology and the system dynamics.
The guaranteed

transient performance bounds of the L1 adaptive controller are essential
towards resolving

this coupling issue. Extensive simulation results demonstrate the
capability of the pro-

posed algorithms to recover the desired

ocking behavior. The proposed algorithms are

implemented on an indoor multi-robot platform.},

	Abstract = {An adaptive controller design method based on neural network is proposed
for reconfigurable flight control systems in the presence of variations
in aerodynamic coefficients or control effectiveness deficiencies
caused by control surface damage. The neural network based adaptive
nonlinear controller is developed by using the backstepping technique
for command following of the angle of attack, sideslip angle, and
bank angle. On-line learning neural networks are implemented to compensate
the control effectiveness decrease and guarantee the robustness to
the uncertainties due to aerodynamic coefficients variations. The
main feature of the proposed controller is that the adaptive controller
is designed by assuming that all of the nonlinear functions of the
system have uncertainties, whereas most of the previous works assume
that only some of the nonlinear functions are unknown. Neural networks
learn through the weight update rules that are derived from the Lyapunov
control theory. The closed-loop stability of the error states is
also investigated. A nonlinear dynamic model of a high performance
aircraft is used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed
control law.},

@article{Moses2011,
	Abstract = {It is claimed that Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) used for civilian/public domain applications will be dominant in the near future. Compared to UAVs used by the military, civilian UAVs are often operated by pilots without formal training, and hence they require increased levels of autonomy and intelligence, especially with regard to reducing threats to public safety. UAV integration into the National Air Space will require that the UAVs support multiple, complementary sense-and-avoid mechanisms, including detection and identification of other UAV-sized targets. Currently, the majority of available sensors are based on infrared detectors, focal plane arrays, optical and ultrasonic rangefinders. These sensors are generally not able to detect or identify other UAV-sized targets and, when detection is possible, considerable computational power may be required for successful identification. By contrast, this paper describes the design of a light weight, X-Band (10.5GHz) radar system for use on a small-scale ({\&}{\#}x003C; 25 kg) rotorcraft. The prototype radar implementation is small enough to be carried by any miniature UAV, and it is capable of differentiating other miniature rotorcraft by their doppler signature. In addition to the overall hardware and software design of the prototype system, a performance analysis of various signature matching algorithms is presented demonstrating the capabilities of the system in a laboratory setting.},

	Abstract = {Abstract---This paper considers the problem of obtaining good

attitude estimates from measurements obtained from typical low

cost inertial measurement units. The outputs of such systems are

characterized by high noise levels and time varying additive biases.

We formulate the filtering problem as deterministic observer

kinematics posed directly on the special orthogonal group SO(3)

driven by reconstructed attitude and angular velocity measurements.

Lyapunov analysis results for the proposed observers are

derived that ensure almost global stability of the observer error.

The approach taken leads to an observer that we term the direct

complementary filter. By exploiting the geometry of the special orthogonal

group a related observer, termed the passive complementary

filter, is derived that decouples the gyro measurements from

the reconstructed attitude in the observer inputs. Both the direct

and passive filters can be extended to estimate gyro bias online.
The

passive filter is further developed to provide a formulation in terms

of the measurement error that avoids any algebraic reconstruction

of the attitude. This leads to an observer on SO(3), termed the

explicit complementary filter, that requires only accelerometer and

gyro outputs; is suitable for implementation on embedded hardware;

and provides good attitude estimates as well as estimating the

gyro biases online. The performance of the observers are demonstrated

with a set of experiments performed on a robotic test-bed

and a radio controlled unmanned aerial vehicle.},

Comments: Journal version of $\backslash$cite{FrazzoliDahlehFeron01}. This paper
describes a path planning algorithm which is reportedly 'probabilistically
complete' and can be executed in real time. The algorithms works
by starting from the current state and then randomly chosing another
equilibrium state and then planning a path from that state and then
testing to see if collisions occured. Collision free paths are kept
and further random exploration is pursued. A notion of tau-safty
is introduced to ensure that planned paths are safe for a time tau
into the future to allow further planning and maneuvering.

The paper describes results for environments that are both static
and dynamic. For dynamic environments, the motion of the obstacles
is known a priori. Time tags are critical when obstacles are in motion.
Our approach with waypoint path planning and dynamic trajectory smoothing
allows efficient time-tagging.},

@article{WebbPrazenicaKurdilaKind07,
	Abstract = { The realization of vision-based, autonomous flight for micro air
vehicles presents numerous technical challenges in diverse fields
such as image processing, trajectory planning, control theory, and
microhardware design. This paper explores one aspect of the overall
problem: robust, real-time estimation of aircraft states from a set
of tracked feature points. This vision-based approach is realized
via an implementation of the implicit extended Kalman filter, a variation
of the classical Kalman filter that allows for nonlinear dynamic
models and updates from measurements that are implicit functions
of the state variables. The epipolar constraint, which is a geometric
relationship between the feature point position vectors and the camera
translation vector, is employed in this paper as the implicit measurement
in the Kalman filter. In order for the vison-based Kalman filter
to provide reliable state estimation, it must be robust with respect
to modeling errors in the dynamic propagator. This is especially
true because the aerodynamic forces and moments acting on a micro
air vehicle are frequently not known to a high degree of accuracy.
Furthermore, the algorithm must be robust with respect to noise in
the measured feature point positions in the image plane. This paper
explores both of these robustness issues using results from a micro
air vehicle simulation model developed at the NASA Langley Research
Center. In particular, a hierarchy of dynamic models, ranging from
a random walk model to a high-fidelity nonlinear micro air vehicle
model, is employed in the Kalman filter for a simulated micro air
vehicle trajectory with varying levels of measurement noise. It is
demonstrated that the visionbased measurement updates in the filter
are capable of compensating for significant modeling errors and filter
initialization errors. As would be expected, superior overall results
are achieved using higher-fidelity dynamic models in the Kalman filter.
The work presented in this paper represents the first step toward
the ultimate objective of incorporating vision-based state estimation
into the design of autonomous flight control systems for micro air
vehicles operating in urban environments. },

	Abstract = {The development and application of increasingly autonomous (IA) systems for civil aviation is proceeding at an accelerating pace, driven by the expectation that such systems will return significant benefits in terms of safety, reliability, efficiency, affordability, and/or previously unattainable mission capabilities. IA systems range from current automatic systems such as autopilots and remotely piloted unmanned aircraft to more highly sophisticated systems that are needed to enable a fully autonomous aircraft that does not require a pilot or human air traffic controllers. These systems, characterized by their ability to perform more complex mission-related tasks with substantially less human intervention for more extended periods of time, sometimes at remote distances, are being envisioned for aircraft and for air traffic management and other ground-based elements of the national airspace system. Civil aviation is on the threshold of potentially revolutionary improvements in aviation capabilities and operations associated with IA systems. These systems, however, face substantial barriers to integration into the national airspace system without degrading its safety or efficiency. Autonomy Research for Civil Aviation identifies key barriers and suggests major elements of a national research agenda to address those barriers and help realize the benefits that IA systems can make to crewed aircraft, unmanned aircraft systems, and ground-based elements of the national airspace system. This report develops a set of integrated and comprehensive technical goals and objectives of importance to the civil aeronautics community and the nation. Autonomy Research for Civil Aviation will be of interest to U.S. research organizations, industry, and academia who have a role in meeting these goals.},

	Abstract = { This paper considers the trajectory tracking problem for unmanned air vehicles (UAVs). We assume that the UAV is equipped with an autopilot which reduces the twelve degree-of-freedom (DOF) model to a six DOF model with altitude, heading, and velocity command inputs. In this paper we restrict our attention to planar motion. One of the novel features of our approach is that we explicitly account for heading and velocity input constraints. For a fixed wing UAV, the velocity is constrained to lie between two positive constants, and therefore presents particular challenges for the control design. We propose a control Lyapunov function (CLF) approach. We first introduce a CLF for the input constrained case, and then construct the set of all constrained inputs that render the CLF negative. The control input is then selected from this "feasible" set. The proposed approach is then applied to a simulation scenario, where a UAV is assigned to transition through several targets in the presence of multiple dynamic threats.},

	Abstract = { Keywords: autopilot adaptive control non affine systems flight control
trajectory tracking 3DOF model adaptive algorithm with projection
Comments: This paper addresses the problem of designing adaptive
control strategies for tracking when the nonlinear system is not
affine in the input. The essential idea is to differentiate the state
equations to get a system that is affine in $\backslash$dot{u}. An application
to a simple 3DOF aircraft model is given and displays some nice results.

The paper gives a nice overview of adaptive algorithms with projection,
where the parameters are constrained to lie within a certain set.
We should definitely implement projection on the control strategies
used in our autopilot. },

multiple robots Comments: Experiments with a PRM Planner on spot-welding
station with up to 6 robots are presented. When performing centralized
planning, the planner has proven to be reliable and fast. When preforming
decentralized planning, it was not significantly faster, but it was
much less reliable. Reduce collision checks by only checking paths
that lead to goal, i.e., collisions are checked after feasible trajectory
is found. PUMA arms are used: myopic collision free paths are planned.
Coordination is achieved through planning the velocity profiles.

	Annote = {This paper considers the problem of transitioning a tailsitter aircraft between level and hover flight in wind conditions. The focus is on the control strategy and not on planning the transition. The idea is to use a path following approach where the time index of a preplanned path is manipulated to ensure that the vehicle stay within the flight envelop.


- The paper is limited to planar (X-Z plane) dynamics. The inputs are thrust and pitch angle.
- The dynamics of the perturbed system in wind are derived.
- An interesting aspect of the paper is explicit definition and calculation of the {\&}quot;hover flight envelop{\&}quot; and the {\&}quot;level flight envelop.{\&}quot;
- The nominal control strategy uses dynamic inversion, which does not include the aerodynamics of the vehicle. The inversion is based on the aerodynamic forces being zero.
- The control law superimposes a feedforward term, a high gain term, and integral action.
- Simulation and/or flight results are not included, and so it is hard to tell how the proposed controller will perform.},

	Abstract = {In tracking applications target motion is usually best modeled in
a simple fashion using Cartesian coordinates. Unfortunately, in most
systems the target position measurements are provided in terms of range
and azimuth (bearing) with respect to the sensor location. This
situation requires either converting the measurements to a Cartesian
frame of reference and working directly on converted measurements or
using an extended Kalman filter (EKF) in mixed coordinates. An accurate
means of tracking with debiased consistent converted measurements which
accounts for the sensor inaccuracies over all practical geometries and
accuracies is presented. This method is compared with the mixed
coordinates EKF approach as well as a previous converted measurement
approach which is an acceptable approximation only for moderate
cross-range errors. The new approach is shown to be more accurate in
terms of position and velocity errors and provides consistent estimates
(i.e., compatible with the filter calculated covariances) for all
practical situations. The combination of parameters (range, range
accuracy, and azimuth accuracy) for which debiasing is needed is
presented in explicit form},

	Abstract = {Abstract---This brief deals with the tracking control design of a
helicopter laboratory experimental setup. In order to be able to
realize highly dynamic flight maneuvers, both input and state constraints
have to be systematically accounted for within the control design
procedure. The mathematical model being considered constitutes a
nonlinear mathematical mechanical system with two control inputs
and three degrees of freedom. The control concept consists of an
inversion-based feedforward controller for trajectory tracking and
a feedback controller for the trajectory error dynamics. The design
of the feedforward controller for a point-topoint flight maneuver
is traced back to the solution of a 2-point boundary value problem
in the Byrnes-Isidori normal form of the mathematical model. By utilizing
special saturation functions, the given constraints in the inputs
and states can be systematically incorporated in the overall design
process. In order to capture model uncertainties and external disturbance,
an optimal state feedback controller is designed on the basis of
the model linearization along the desired trajectories. The proposed
control scheme is implemented in a real-time environment, and the
feasibility and the excellent performance are demonstrated by means
of experimental results.

do a feedforward-feedback design where the feedforward trajectory

This paper is particularly challenging in the presence of wind. The equations of motion of the cable using an elastic model are presented. Based on the differential flatness of the system with the knowledge of the wind, the desired mothership trajectory can be calculated from the desired drogue orbit. A Lyapunov-based controller derived using backstepping is proposed that enables tracking error of mothership to exponentially converge to an ultimate bound, where the size of the ultimate bound is a function of the unknown portion of the wind. Simulation results verify the feasibility of the approach.},

abstract = {The theory and practice of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) capture and control via Global Positioning System (GPS) signal spoofing are analyzed and demonstrated. The goal of this work is to explore UAV vulnerability to deceptive GPS signals. Specifically, this paper (1) establishes the necessary conditions for UAV capture via GPS spoofing, and (2) explores the spoofer's range of possible post-capture control over the UAV. A UAV is considered captured when a spoofer gains the ability to eventually specify the UAV's position and velocity estimates. During post-capture control, the spoofer manipulates the true state of the UAV, potentially resulting in the UAV flying far from its flight plan without raising alarms. Both overt and covert spoofing strategies are considered, as distinguished by the spoofer's attempts to evade detection by the target GPS receiver and by the target navigation system's state estimator, which is presumed to have access to non-GPS navigation sensor data. GPS receiver tracking loops are analyzed and tested to assess the spoofer's capability for covert capture of a mobile target. The coupled dynamics of a UAV and spoofer are analyzed and simulated to explore practical post-capture control scenarios. A field test demonstrates capture and rudimentary control of a rotorcraft UAV, which results in unrecoverable navigation errors that cause the UAV to crash.},,

abstract={This paper addresses the problem of target handoff between two fixed wing aircraft that do not have access to GPS. The problem requires estimating the relative pose between the vehicles. We examine the observability of the relative states needed to do the handoff when the relative position vector between the aircraft is measured, as would be the case for a radar or a lidar sensor. We assume that the two aircraft do not exchange their airspeed and turn rate information. Under mild assumptions, we show that the relative heading between the two aircraft is observable. The paper also proposes an estimation algorithm that uses a bank of extended Kalman filters (EKF) to estimate the relative states. Simulation results demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed approach and the advantages of the EKF bank over a single EKF in a high-noise scenario.},
